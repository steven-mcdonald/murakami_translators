       "'I was 37 then, strapped in my seat as the huge 747 plunged through\\ndense cloud cover on approach to Hamburg airport. Cold November\\nrains drenched the earth, lending everything the gloomy air of a\\nFlemish landscape: the ground crew in waterproofs, a flag atop a squat\\nairport building, a BMW billboard. So - Germany again. Once the plane was on the ground, soft music began to flow from the\\nceiling speakers: a sweet orchestral cover version of the Beatles\\'\\n\"Norwegian Wood\". The melody never failed to send a shudder\\nthrough me, but this time it hit me harder than ever. I bent forward, my face in my hands to keep my skull from splitting\\nopen. Before long one of the German stewardesses approached and\\nasked in English if I were sick. \"No,\" I said, \"just dizzy.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes, I\\'m sure. Thanks.\" She smiled and left, and the music changed to a Billy Joel tune. I\\nstraightened up and looked out of the window at the dark clouds\\nhanging over the North Sea, thinking of all I had lost in the course of\\nmy life: times gone for ever, friends who had died or disappeared,\\nfeelings I would never know again. The plane reached the gate. People began unfastening their seatbelts\\nand pulling luggage from the overhead lockers, and all the while I was\\nin the meadow. I could smell the grass, feel the wind on my face, hear\\nthe cries of the birds. Autumn 1969, and soon I would be 20. The stewardess came to check on me again. This time she sat next to\\nme and asked if I was all right. \"I\\'m fine, thanks,\" I said with a smile. \"Just feeling kind of blue.\" \"I know what you mean,\" she said. \"It happens to me, too, every once\\nin a while.\" She stood and gave me a lovely smile. \"Well, then, have a nice trip.\\nAuf Wiedersehen.\" \"Auf Wiedersehen.\" Eighteen years have gone by, and still I can bring back every detail of\\nthat day in the meadow. Washed clean of summer\\'s dust by days of\\ngentle rain, the mountains wore a deep, brilliant green. The October\\nbreeze set white fronds of head-high grasses swaying. One long streak\\nof cloud hung pasted across a dome of frozen blue. It almost hurt to\\nlook at that far-off sky. A puff of wind swept across the meadow and\\nthrough her hair before it slipped into the woods to rustle branches and\\nsend back snatches of distant barking - a hazy sound that seemed to\\nreach us from the doorway to another world. We heard no other\\nsounds. We met no other people. We saw only two bright red birds\\nleap startled from the center of the meadow and dart into the woods.\\nAs we ambled along, Naoko spoke to me of wells. Memory is a funny thing. When I was in the scene I hardly paid it any\\nattention. I never stopped to think of it as something that would make\\na lasting impression, certainly never imagined that 18 years later I\\nwould recall it in such detail. I didn’t give a damn about the scenery\\nthat day. I was thinking about myself. I was thinking about the\\nbeautiful girl walking next to me. I was thinking about the two of us\\ntogether, and then about myself again. I was at that age, that time of\\nlife when every sight, every feeling, every thought came back, like a\\nboomerang, to me. And worse, I was in love. Love with\\ncomplications. Scenery was the last thing on my mind. Now, though, that meadow scene is the first thing that comes back to\\nme. The smell of the grass, the faint chill of the wind, the line of the\\nhills, the barking of a dog: these are the first things, and they come\\nwith absolute clarity. I feel as if I can reach out and trace them with a\\nfingertip. And yet, as clear as the scene may be, no one is in it. No\\none. Naoko is not there, and neither am I. Where could we have\\ndisappeared to? How could such a thing have happened? Everything\\nthat seemed so important back then - Naoko, and the self I was then,\\nand the world I had then: where could they have all gone? It\\'s true, I\\ncan\\'t even bring back her face - not straight away, at least. All I\\'m left\\nholding is a background, pure scenery, with no people at the front. True, given time enough, I can remember her face. I start joining\\nimages - her tiny, cold hand; her straight, black hair so smooth and\\ncool to the touch; a soft, rounded earlobe and the microscopic mole\\njust beneath it; the camel-hair coat she wore in the winter; her habit of\\nlooking straight into my eyes when asking a question; the slight\\ntrembling that would come to her voice now and then (as though she\\nwere speaking on a windy hilltop) - and suddenly her face is there,\\nalways in profile at first, because Naoko and I were always out\\nwalking together, side by side. Then she turns to me and smiles, and\\ntilts her head just a little, and begins to speak, and she looks into my\\neyes as if trying to catch the image of a minnow that has darted across\\nthe pool of a limpid spring. It takes time, though, for Naoko\\'s face to appear. And as the years\\nhave passed, the time has grown longer. The sad truth is that what I\\ncould recall in 5 seconds all too soon needed 10, then 30, then a full\\nminute - like shadows lengthening at dusk. Someday, I suppose, the\\nshadows will be swallowed up in darkness. There is no way around it:\\nmy memory is growing ever more distant from the spot where Naoko\\nused to stand - where my old self used to stand. And nothing but\\nscenery, that view of the meadow in October, returns again and again\\nto me like a symbolic scene in a film. Each time it appears, it delivers a kick to some part of my mind. \\nWake up,\\n \\nit says. \\nI\\'m still here. Wake\\nup and think about it. Think about why I\\'m still here.\\n \\nThe kicking\\nnever hurts me. There\\'s no pain at all. Just a hollow sound that echoes\\nwith each kick. And even that is bound to fade one day. At Hamburg\\nairport, though, the kicks were longer and harder than usual. Which is\\nwhy I am writing this book. To think. To understand. It just happens\\nto be the way I\\'m made. I have to write things down to feel I fully\\ncomprehend them. Let\\'s see, now, what was Naoko talking about that day? Of course: the \"field well\". I have no idea whether there was such a\\nwell. It might have been an image or a sign that existed only inside\\nNaoko, like all the other things she used to spin into existence inside\\nher mind in those dark days. Once she had described it to me, though,\\nI was never able to think of that meadow scene without the well. From\\nthat day forward, the image of a thing I had never laid eyes on became\\ninseparably fused to the actual scene of the field that lay before me. I\\ncan describe the well in minute detail. It lay precisely on the border\\nwhere the meadow ended and the woods began - a dark opening in the\\nearth a yard across, hidden by grass. Nothing marked its perimeter -\\nno fence, no stone curb (at least not one that rose above ground level).\\nIt was nothing but a hole, a wide-open mouth. The stones of its collar\\nhad been weathered and turned a strange muddy-white. They were\\ncracked and chunks were missing, and a little green lizard slithered\\ninto an open seam. You could lean over the edge and peer down to see\\nnothing. All I knew about the well was its frightening depth. It was\\ndeep beyond measuring, and crammed full of darkness, as if all the\\nworld\\'s darknesses had been boiled down to their ultimate density. \"It\\'s really, \\nreally\\n \\ndeep,\" said Naoko, choosing her words with care.\\nShe would speak that way sometimes, slowing down to find the exact\\nword she was looking for. \"But no one knows where it is,\" she\\ncontinued. \"The one thing I know for sure is that it\\'s around here somewhere.\" Hands thrust into the pockets of her tweed jacket, she smiled at me as\\nif to say \"It\\'s true!\" \"Then it must be incredibly dangerous,\" I said. \"A deep well, but\\nnobody knows where it is. You could fall in and that\\'d be the end of\\nyou.\" \"The end. Aaaaaaaah! Splat! Finished.\" \"Things like that must happen.\" \"They do, every once in a while. Maybe once in two or three years.\\nSomebody disappears all of a sudden, and they just can\\'t find him. So\\nthen the people around here say, \"Oh, he fell in the field well’.\" \"Not a nice way to die,\" I said. \"No, it\\'s a terrible way to die,\" said Naoko, brushing a cluster of grass\\nseed from her jacket. \"The best thing would be to break your neck, but\\nyou’d probably just break your leg and then you couldn\\'t do a thing.\\nYou\\'d yell at the top of your lungs, but nobody would hear you, and\\nyou couldn\\'t expect anyone to find you, and you\\'d have centipedes and\\nspiders crawling all over you, and the bones of the ones who died\\nbefore are scattered all around you, and it\\'s dark and soggy, and high\\noverhead there\\'s this tiny, tiny circle of light like a winter moon. You\\ndie there in this place, little by little, all by yourself.\" \"Yuck, just thinking about it makes my flesh creep,\" I said.\\n\"Somebody should find the thing and build a wall around it.\" \"But nobody \\ncan\\n find it. So make sure you don’t go off the path.\" \"Don\\'t worry, I won’t.\" Naoko took her left hand from her pocket and squeezed my hand.\\n\"Don\\'t \\nyou\\n worry,\" she said. \"You\\'ll be OK. \\nYou\\n could go running all\\naround here in the middle of the night and you\\'d \\nnever\\n fall into the\\nwell. And as long as I stick with you, I won\\'t fall in, either.\" \"Never?\" \"Never!\" \"How can you be so sure?\" \"I just know,\" she said, increasing her grip on my hand and walking\\nalong in silence. \"I know these things. I\\'m always right. It\\'s got\\nnothing to do with logic: I just feel it. For example, when I\\'m really\\nclose to you like this. I\\'m not the least bit scared. Nothing dark or evil\\ncould ever tempt me.\" \"Well, that\\'s the answer,\" I said. \"All you have to do is stay with me\\nlike this all the time.\" \"Do you mean that?\" \"Of course.\" Naoko stopped short. So did I. She put her hands on my shoulders and\\npeered into my eyes. Deep within her own pattern. Those beautiful\\neyes of hers were looking inside me for a long, long time. Then she\\nstretched to her full height and touched her cheek to mine. It was a\\nmarvelous, warm gesture that stopped my heart for a moment. \"Thank you.\" \"My pleasure,\" I answered. \"I\\'m so happy you said that. Really happy,\" she said with a sad smile.\\n\"But it\\'s impossible.\" \"Impossible? Why?\" \"It would be wrong. It would be terrible. It -\" Naoko clamped her mouth shut and started walking again. I could tell\\nthat all kinds of thoughts were whirling around in her head, so rather\\nthan intrude on them I kept silent and walked by her side. \"It would be wrong - wrong for you, wrong for me,\" she said after a\\nlong pause. \"Wrong how?\" I murmured. \"Don\\'t you see? It\\'s just not possible for one person to watch over\\nanother person forever and ever. I mean, suppose we got married.\\nYou’d have to work during the day. Who\\'s going to watch over me\\nwhile you\\'re away? Or if you go on a business trip, who\\'s going to\\nwatch over me then? Can I be glued to you every minute of our lives?\\nWhat kind of equality would there be in that? What kind of relationship would that be? Sooner or later you\\'d get sick of me. You\\'d\\nwonder what you were doing with your life, why you were spending\\nall your time babysitting this woman. I couldn’t stand that. It wouldn\\'t\\nsolve any of my problems.\" \"But your problems are not going to continue for the rest of your life,\"\\nI said, touching her back. \"They\\'ll end eventually. And when they do,\\nwe\\'ll stop and think about how to go on from there. Maybe you will\\nhave to help \\nme.\\n We\\'re not running our lives according to some\\naccount book. If you need me, use me. Don\\'t you see? Why do you\\nhave to be so rigid? Relax, let down your guard. You\\'re all tensed up\\nso you always expect the worst. Relax your body, and the rest of you\\nwill lighten up.\" \"How can you say that?\" she asked in a voice drained of feeling.\\nNaoko\\'s voice alerted me to the possibility that I had said something I\\nshouldn’t have. \"Tell me how you could say such a thing,\" she said, staring at the\\nground beneath her feet. \"You\\'re not telling me anything I don\\'t know\\nalready. \"Relax your body, and the rest of you will lighten up.\\' What\\'s\\nthe point of saying that to me? If I relaxed my body now. I\\'d fall apart.\\nI\\'ve always lived like this, and it\\'s the only way I know how to go on\\nliving. If I relaxed for a second. I\\'d never find my way back. I’d go to\\npieces, and the pieces would be blown away. Why can\\'t you see that?\\nHow can you talk about watching over me if you can\\'t see that?\" I said nothing. \"I\\'m confused. Really confused. And it\\'s a lot deeper than you think.\\nDeeper ... darker ... colder. But tell me something. How could you\\nhave slept with me that time? How could you have done such a thing?\\nWhy didn\\'t you just leave me alone?\" Now we were walking through the frightful silence of a pine forest.\\nThe desiccated corpses of cicadas that had died at the end of summer\\nlittered the surface of the path, crunching beneath our shoes. As if\\nsearching for something we’d lost, Naoko and I continued slowly along the path. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she said, taking my arm and shaking her head. \"I didn’t mean to hurt you. Try not to let what I said bother you.\\nReally, I\\'m sorry. I was just angry at myself.\" \"I suppose I don’t really understand you yet,\" I said. \"I\\'m not all that\\nsmart. It takes me a while to understand things. But if I do have the\\ntime, \\nI will\\n come to understand you - better than anyone else in the\\nworld.\" We came to a stop and stood in the silent forest, listening. I tumbled\\npinecones and cicada shells with my toecap, then looked up at the\\npatches of sky showing through the pine branches. Hands in pockets,\\nNaoko stood there thinking, her eyes focused on nothing in particular.\\n\"Tell me something, Toru,\" she said. \"Do you love me?\" \"You know I do.\" \"Will you do me two favors?\" \"You can have up to three wishes, Madame.\" Naoko smiled and shook her head. \"No, two will do. One is for you to\\nrealize how grateful I am that you came to see me here. I hope you\\'ll\\nunderstand how happy you\\'ve made me. I know it\\'s going to save me\\nif anything will. I may not show it, but it\\'s true.\" \"I\\'ll come to see you again,\" I said. \"And what is the other wish?\" \"I want you always to remember me. Will you remember that I\\nexisted, and that I stood next to you here like this?\" \"Always,\" I said. \"I\\'ll always remember.\" She walked on without speaking. The autumn light filtering through\\nthe branches danced over the shoulders of her jacket. A dog barked\\nagain, closer than before. Naoko climbed a small mound, walked out\\nof the forest and hurried down a gentle slope. I followed two or three\\nsteps behind. \"Come over here,\" I called towards her back. \"The well might be\\naround here somewhere.\" Naoko stopped and smiled and took my\\narm. We walked the rest of the way side by side. \"Do you really promise never to forget me?\" she asked in a near whisper. \"I\\'ll never forget you,\" I said. \\n\"I could\\n never forget you.\" Even so, my memory has grown increasingly dim, and I have already\\nforgotten any number of things. Writing from memory like this, I\\noften feel a pang of dread. What if I\\'ve forgotten the most important\\nthing? What if somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all\\nthe truly important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?\\nBe that as it may, it\\'s all I have to work with. Clutching these faded,\\nfading, imperfect memories to my breast, I go on writing this book\\nwith all the desperate intensity of a starving man sucking on bones.\\nThis is the only way I know to keep my promise to Naoko. Once, long ago, when I was still young, when the memories were far\\nmore vivid than they are now, I often tried to write about her. But I\\ncouldn\\'t produce a line. I knew that if that first line would come, the\\nrest would pour itself onto the page, but I could never make it happen.\\nEverything was too sharp and clear, so that I could never tell where to\\nstart - the way a map that shows too much can sometimes be useless.\\nNow, though, I realize that all I can place in the imperfect vessel of\\nwriting are imperfect memories and imperfect thoughts. The more the\\nmemories of Naoko inside me fade, the more deeply I am able to\\nunderstand her. I know, too, why she asked me not to forget her.\\nNaoko herself knew, of course. She knew that my memories of her\\nwould fade. Which is precisely why she begged me never to forget\\nher, to remember that she had existed. The thought fills me with an almost unbearable sorrow. Because\\nNaoko never loved me. \\n \\n \\n \\n Once upon a time, many years ago - just 20 years ago, in fact -1 was\\nliving in a dormitory. I was 18 and a first-year student. I was new to\\nTokyo and new to living alone, and so my anxious parents found a\\nprivate dorm for me to live in rather than the kind of single room that\\nmost students took. The dormitory provided meals and other facilities\\nand would probably help their unworldly 18-year-old survive.\\nExpenses were also a consideration. A dorm cost far less than a\\nprivate room. As long as I had bedding and a lamp, there was no need\\nto buy a lot of furnishings. For my part, I would have preferred to rent\\na flat and live in comfortable solitude, but knowing what my parents\\nhad to spend on enrolment fees and tuition at the private university I\\nwas attending, I was in no position to insist. And besides, I really\\ndidn\\'t care where I lived. Located on a hill in the middle of the city with open views, the\\ndormitory compound sat on a large quadrangle surrounded by a\\nconcrete wall. A huge, towering zelkova tree stood just inside the\\nfront gate. People said it was at least 150 years old. Standing at its\\nbase, you could look up and see nothing of the sky through its dense\\ncover of green leaves. The paved path leading from the gate circumvented the tree and\\ncontinued on long and straight across a broad quadrangle, two three-\\nstory concrete dorm buildings facing each other on either side of the\\npath. They were large with lots of windows and gave the impression\\nof being either flats that had been converted into jails or jails that had\\nbeen converted into flats. However there was nothing dirty about\\nthem, nor did they feel dark. You could hear radios playing through\\nopen windows, all of which had the same cream-coloured curtains that\\nthe sun could not fade. Beyond the two dormitories, the path led up to the entrance\\nof a two-story common building, the first floor of which contained a\\ndining hall and bathrooms, the second consisting of an auditorium,\\nmeeting rooms, and even guest rooms, whose use I could never fathom. Next to the common building stood a third dormitory, also\\nthree storeys high. Broad green lawns filled the quadrangle, and\\ncirculating sprinklers caught the sunlight as they turned. Behind the\\ncommon building there was a field used for baseball and football, and\\nsix tennis courts. The complex had everything you could want. There was just one problem with the place: its political smell. It was\\nrun by some kind of fishy foundation that centered on this extreme\\nright-wing guy, and there was something strangely twisted - as far as I\\nwas concerned - about the way they ran the place. You could see it in\\nthe pamphlet they gave to new students and in the dorm rules. The\\nproclaimed \"founding spirit\" of the dormitory was \"to strive to nurture\\nhuman resources of service to the nation through the ultimate in\\neducational fundamentals\", and many financial leaders who endorsed\\nthis \"spirit\" had contributed their private funds to the construction of\\nthe place. This was the public face of the project, though what lay\\nbehind it was extremely vague. Some said it was a tax dodge, others\\nsaw it as a publicity stunt for the contributors, and still others claimed\\nthat the construction of the dormitory was a cover for swindling the\\npublic out of a prime piece of real estate. One thing was certain,\\nthough: in the dorm complex there existed a privileged club composed\\nof elite students from various universities. They formed \"study\\ngroups\" that met several times a month and included some of the\\nfounders. Any member of the club could be assured of a good job after\\ngraduation. I had no idea which - if any - of these theories was correct,\\nbut they all shared the assumption that there was \"something fishy\"\\nabout the place. In any case, I spent two years - from the spring of 1968 to the spring\\nof 1970 - living in this \"fishy\" dormitory. Why I put up with it so long,\\nI can\\'t really say. In terms of everyday life, it made no practical\\ndifference to me whether the place was right wing or left wing or\\nanything else. Each day began with the solemn raising of the flag. They played the national anthem, too, of course. You can\\'t have one without the other.\\nThe flagpole stood in the very center of the compound, where it was\\nvisible from every window of all three dormitories. The Head of the east dormitory (my building) was in charge of the\\nflag. He was a tall, eagle-eyed man in his late fifties or early sixties.\\nHis bristly hair was flecked with grey, and his sunburned neck bore a\\nlong scar. People whispered that he was a graduate of the wartime\\nNakano spy school, but no one knew for sure. Next to him stood a\\nstudent who acted as his assistant. No one really knew this guy, either.\\nHe had the world\\'s shortest crewcut and always wore a navy-blue\\nstudent uniform. I didn’t know his name or which room he lived in,\\nnever saw him in the dining hall or the bath. I’m not even sure he was\\na student, though you would think he must have been, given the\\nuniform - which quickly became his nickname. In contrast to Sir\\nNakano, \"Uniform\" was short, pudgy and pasty-faced. This creepy\\ncouple would raise the banner of the Rising Sun every morning at six.\\nWhen I first entered the dormitory, the sheer novelty of the event\\nwould often prompt me to get up early to observe this patriotic ritual.\\nThe two would appear in the quadrangle at almost the exact moment\\nthe radio beeped the six o\\'clock signal. Uniform was wearing his\\nuniform, of course, with black leather shoes, and Nakano wore a short\\njacket and white trainers. Uniform held a ceremonial box of untreated\\npaulownia wood, while Nakano carried a Sony tape recorder at his\\nside. He placed this at the base of the flagpole, while Uniform opened\\nthe box to reveal a neatly folded banner. This he reverentially\\nproffered to Nakano, who would clip it to the rope on the flagpole,\\nrevealing the bright red circle of the Rising Sun on a field of pure\\nwhite. Then Uniform pressed the switch for the playing of the anthem.\\n\"May Our Lord\\'s Reign...\" And up the flag would climb. \"Until pebbles turn to boulders ...\" It would reach halfway up the pole.\\n\"And be covered with moss.\" Now it was at the top. The two stood to attention, rigid, looking up at\\nthe flag, which was quite a sight on clear days when the wind was\\nblowing. The lowering of the flag at dusk was carried out with the same\\nceremonial reverence, but in reverse. Down the banner would come\\nand find its place in the box. The national flag did not fly at night. I didn’t know why the flag had to be taken down at night. The nation\\ncontinued to exist while it was dark, and plenty of people worked all\\nnight - railway construction crews and taxi drivers and bar hostesses\\nand firemen and night watchmen: it seemed unfair to me that such\\npeople were denied the protection of the flag. Or maybe it didn’t\\nmatter all that much and nobody really cared - aside from me. Not that\\nI really cared, either. It was just something that happened to cross my\\nmind. The rules for room assignments put first- and second-year students in\\ndoubles while third- and final-year students had single rooms. Double\\nrooms were a little longer and narrower than nine-by-twelve, with an\\naluminium-framed window in the wall opposite the door and two\\ndesks by the window arranged so the inhabitants of the room could\\nstudy back-to-back. To the left of the door stood a steel bunk bed. The\\nfurniture supplied was sturdy and simple and included a pair of\\nlockers, a small coffee table, and some built-in shelves. Even the most\\nwell-disposed observer would have had trouble calling this setting\\npoetic. The shelves of most rooms carried such items as transistor\\nradios, hairdryers, electric carafes and cookers, instant coffee, tea\\nbags, sugar cubes, and simple pots and bowls for preparing instant\\nramen. The walls bore pin-ups from girlie magazines or stolen porno\\nmovie posters. One guy had a photo of pigs mating, but this was a far-\\nout exception to the usual naked women, girl pop singers or actresses.\\nBookshelves on the desks held textbooks, dictionaries and novels. The filth of these all-male rooms was horrifying. Mouldy mandarin\\nskins clung to the bottoms of waste-paper baskets. Empty cans used for ashtrays held mounds of cigarette butts, and when these started to\\nsmoulder they\\'d be doused with coffee or beer and left to give off a\\nsour stink. Blackish grime and bits of indefinable matter clung to all the bowls and dishes\\non the shelves, and the floors were littered with instant ramen\\nwrappers and empty beer cans and discarded lids from one thing or\\nanother. It never occurred to anyone to sweep up and throw these\\nthings in the bin. Any wind that blew through would raise clouds of\\ndust. Each room had its own horrendous smell, but the components of\\nthat smell were always the same: sweat, body odour and rubbish.\\nDirty clothes would pile up under the beds, and without anyone\\nbothering to air the mattresses on a regular basis, these sweat-\\nimpregnated pads would give off odours beyond redemption. In\\nretrospect, it seems amazing that these shitpiles gave rise to no killer\\nepidemics. My room, on the other hand, was as sanitary as a morgue. The floor\\nand window were spotless, the mattresses were aired each week, all\\npencils stood in the pencil holders, and even the curtains were washed\\nonce a month. My room-mate was a cleanliness freak. None of the\\nothers in the dorm believed me when I told them about the curtains.\\nThey didn\\'t know that curtains \\ncould\\n be washed. They believed,\\nrather, that curtains were semi-permanent parts of the window.\\n\"There\\'s something wrong with that guy,\" they’d say, labelling him a\\nNazi or a storm trooper. We didn’t even have pin-ups. No, we had a photo of a canal in\\nAmsterdam. I had put up a nude shot, but my room-mate had pulled it\\ndown. \"Hey, Watanabe,\" he said. \"I-I\\'m not too crazy about this kind\\nof thing,\" and up went the canal photo instead. I wasn\\'t especially\\nattached to the nude, so I didn’t protest. \"What the hell\\'s \\nthat?\"\\n was the universal reaction to the Amsterdam\\nphoto whenever any of the other guys came to my room. \"Oh, Storm Trooper likes to wank looking at this,\" I said. I meant it as a joke, but they all took me seriously - so seriously that I\\nbegan to believe it myself. Everybody sympathized with me for having Storm Trooper as a roommate, but I really wasn\\'t that upset about it. He left me alone as long as\\nI kept my area clean, and in fact having him as my room-mate made\\nthings easier for me in many ways. He did all the cleaning, he took\\ncare of sunning the mattresses, he threw out the rubbish. He\\'d give a\\nsniff and suggest a bath for me if I’d been too busy to wash for a few\\ndays. He’d even point out when it was time for me to go to the barber\\'s\\nor trim my nasal hair. The one thing that bothered me was the way he\\nwould spray clouds of insecticide if he noticed a single fly in the\\nroom, because then I had to take refuge in a neighbouring shitpile.\\nStorm Trooper was studying geography at a national university. As he told me the first time we met, \"I\\'m studying m-m-maps.\" \"You like maps?\" I asked. \"Yup. When I graduate. I’m going to work for the Geographical\\nSurvey Institute and make m-m-maps.\" I was impressed by the variety of dreams and goals that life could\\noffer. This was one of the very first new impressions I received when I\\ncame to Tokyo for the first time. The thought struck me that society\\nneeded\\n a few people - just a few - who were interested in and even\\npassionate about mapmaking. Odd, though, that someone who wanted\\nto work for the government\\'s Geographical Survey Institute should\\nstutter every time he said the word \"map\". Storm Trooper often didn\\'t\\nstutter at all, except when he pronounced the word \"map\", for which it\\nwas a 100 per cent certainty. \"W what are \\nyou\\n studying?\" he asked me. \"Drama,\" I said. \"Gonna put on plays?\" \"Nah, just read scripts and do research. Racine, Ionesco, Shakespeare,\\nstuff like that.\" He said he had heard of Shakespeare but not the others. I hardly knew anything about the others myself. I\\'d just seen their names in lecture\\nhandouts. \"You like plays?\" he asked. \"Not especially.\" This confused him, and when he was confused, his stuttering got\\nworse. I felt sorry 1 had done that to him. \"I could have picked anything,\" I said. \"Ethnology, Asian history. I\\njust happened to pick drama, that\\'s all,\" which was not the most\\nconvincing explanation 1 could have come up with. \"I don\\'t get it,\" he said, looking as if he really didn’t get it. \"I like m-\\nm-maps, so I decided to come to Tokyo and get my parents to s-send\\nme money so I could study m-m-maps. But not you, huh?\" His approach made more sense than mine. I gave up trying to explain\\nmyself. Then we drew lots (matchsticks) to choose bunks. He got the\\nupper bunk. Tall, with a crewcut and high cheekbones, he always wore the same\\noutfit: white shirt, black trousers, black shoes, navy-blue jumper. To\\nthese he would add a uniform jacket and black briefcase when he went\\nto his university: a typical right-wing student. Which is why\\neverybody called him Storm Trooper. But in fact he was totally\\nindifferent to politics. He wore a uniform because he didn’t want to be\\nbothered choosing clothes. What interested him were things like\\nchanges in the coastline or the completion of a new railway tunnel.\\nNothing dse. He\\'d go on for hours once he got started on a subject\\nlike that, until you either ran away or fell asleep. He was up at six each morning with the strains of \"May Our Lord\\'s\\nReign\". Which is to say that that ostentatious flag-raising ritual was\\nnot entirely useless. He\\'d get dressed, go to the bathroom and wash his\\nface - for ever. I sometimes got the feeling he must be taking out each\\ntooth and washing it, one at a time. Back in the room, he would snap\\nthe wrinkles out of his towel and lay it on the radiator to dry, then\\nreturn his toothbrush and soap to the shelf. Finally he\\'d do radio callisthenics with the rest of the nation. I was used to reading late at night and sleeping until eight o\\'clock, so\\neven when he started shuffling around the room and exercising, I\\nremained unconscious - until the part where he started jumping. He\\ntook his jumping seriously and made the bed bounce every time he hit\\nthe floor. I stood it for three days because they had told us that\\ncommunal life called for a certain degree of resignation, but by the\\nmorning of the fourth day, I couldn’t take it any more. \"Hey, can you do that on the roof or somewhere?\" I said. \"I can\\'t\\nsleep.\" \"But it\\'s already 6.30!\" he said, open-mouthed. \"Yeah, I \\nknow\\n it\\'s 6.30. I\\'m still supposed to be asleep. I don\\'t know\\nhow to explain it exactly, but that\\'s how it works for me.\" \"Anyway, I can\\'t do it on the roof. Somebody on the third floor would\\ncomplain. Here, we\\'re over a storeroom.\" \"So go out on the quad. On the lawn.\" \"That\\'s no good, either. I don\\'t have a transistor radio. I need to plug it\\nin. And you can\\'t do radio callisthenics without music.\" True, his radio was an old piece of junk without batteries. Mine was a\\ntransistor portable, but it was strictly FM, for music. \"OK, let\\'s compromise,\" I said. \"Do your exercises but cut out the\\njumping part. It\\'s so damned noisy. What do you say?\" \"J-jumping? What\\'s that?\" \"Jumping is jumping. Bouncing up and down.\" \"But there isn\\'t any\\njumping.\" My head was starting to hurt. I was ready to give up, but I wanted to\\nmake my point. I got out of bed and started bouncing up and down\\nand singing the opening melody of NHK\\'s radio callisthenics. \"I\\'m\\ntalking about \\nthis,\"\\n I said. \"Oh, \\nthat.\\n I guess you\\'re right. I never noticed.\" \"See what I mean?\" I said, sitting on the edge of the bed. \"Just cut out\\nthat part. I can put up with the rest. Stop jumping and let me sleep.\" \"But that\\'s impossible,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"I can\\'t leave\\nanything out. I\\'ve been doing the same thing every day for ten years,\\nand once I start I do the whole routine unconsciously. If I left\\nsomething out, I wouldn\\'t be able to do any of it.\" There was nothing more for me to say. What \\ncould\\n I have said? The\\nquickest way to put a stop to this was to wait for him to leave the\\nroom and throw his goddamn radio out the goddamn window, but I\\nknew if I did that all hell would break loose. Storm Trooper treasured\\neverything he owned. He smiled when he saw me sitting on the bed at\\na loss for words, and tried to comfort me. \"Hey, Watanabe, why don’t you just get up and exercise with me?\"\\nAnd he went off to breakfast. Naoko chuckled when I told her the story of Storm Trooper and his\\nradio callisthenics. I hadn\\'t been trying to amuse her, but I ended up\\nlaughing myself. Though her smile vanished in an instant, I enjoyed\\nseeing it for the first time in a long while. We had left the train at Yotsuya and were walking along the\\nembankment by the station. It was a Sunday afternoon in the middle\\nof May. The brief on-and-off showers of the morning had cleared up\\nbefore noon, and a south wind had swept away the low-hanging\\nclouds. The brilliant green leaves of the cherry trees stirred in the air,\\nsplashing sunlight in all directions. This was an early summer day.\\nThe people we passed carried their jumpers or jackets over their\\nshoulders or in their arms. Everyone looked happy in the warm\\nSunday afternoon sun. The young men playing tennis in the courts\\nbeyond the embankment had stripped down to their shorts. Only\\nwhere two nuns in winter habits sat talking on a bench did the summer\\nlight seem not to reach, though both wore looks of satisfaction as they\\nenjoyed chatting in the sun. Fifteen minutes of walking and I was sweaty enough to take off my\\nthick cotton shirt and go with a T-shirt. Naoko had rolled the sleeves of her light grey sweatshirt up to her elbows. It was nicely faded,\\nobviously having been washed many times. I felt as if I had seen her\\nin that shirt long before. This was just a feeling I had, not a clear\\nmemory. I didn\\'t have that much to remember about Naoko at the\\ntime. \"How do you like communal living?\" she asked. \"Is it fun to live with\\na lot of other people?\" \"I don’t know. I’ve only been doing it a month or so. It’s not that bad, I\\ncan stand it.\" She stopped at a fountain and took a sip, wiping her mouth with a\\nwhite handkerchief she took from her trouser pocket. Then she bent\\nover and carefully retied her laces. \"Do you think I could do it?\" \"What? Living in a dorm?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"I suppose it’s all a matter of attitude. You could let a lot of things\\nbother you if you wanted to - the rules, the idiots who think they\\'re hot\\nshit, the room-mates doing radio callisthenics at 6.30 in the morning.\\nBut it\\'s pretty much the same anywhere you go, you can manage.\" \"I guess so,\" she said with a nod. She seemed to be turning something\\nover in her mind. Then she looked straight into my eyes as if peering\\nat some unusual object. Now I saw that her eyes were so deep and\\nclear they made my heart thump. I realized that I had never had\\noccasion to look into her eyes like this. It was the first time the two of\\nus had ever gone walking together or talked at such length. \"Are you thinking about living in a dorm or something?\" I asked.\\n\"Uh-uh,\" she said. \"I was just wondering what communal life would\\nbe like. And. ..\" She seemed to be trying - and failing - to find exactly\\nthe right word or expression. Then she sighed and looked down. \"Oh,\\nI don\\'t know. Never mind.\" That was the end of the conversation. She continued walking east, and\\nI followed just behind. Almost a year had gone by since I had last seen Naoko, and in that\\ntime she had lost so much weight as to look like a different person.\\nThe plump cheeks that had been a special feature of hers were all but\\ngone, and her neck had become delicate and slender. Not that she was\\nbony now or unhealthy looking: there was something natural and\\nserene about the way she had slimmed down, as if she had been hiding\\nin some long, narrow space until she herself had become long and\\nnarrow. And a lot prettier than I remembered. I wanted to tell her that,\\nbut couldn\\'t find a good way to put it. We had not planned to meet but had run into each other on the Chuo\\ncommuter line. She had decided to see a film by herself, and I was\\nheaded for the bookshops in Kanda - nothing urgent in either case.\\nShe had suggested that we leave the train, which we happened to do in\\nYotsuya, where the green embankment makes for a nice place to walk\\nby the old castle moat. Alone together, we had nothing in particular to\\ntalk about, and I wasn\\'t quite sure why Naoko had suggested we get\\noff the train. We had never really had much to say to each other. Naoko started walking the minute we hit the street, and I hurried after\\nher, keeping a few paces behind. I could have closed the distance\\nbetween us, but something held me back. I walked with my eyes on\\nher shoulders and her straight black hair. She wore a big, brown\\nhairslide, and when she turned her head I caught a glimpse of a small,\\nwhite ear. Now and then she would look back and say something.\\nSometimes it would be a remark I might have responded to, and sometimes it would be something to which I had no idea how to reply.\\nOther times, I simply couldn’t hear what she was saying. She didn\\'t\\nseem to care one way or another. Once she had finished saying\\nwhatever she wanted to say, she’d face front again and keep on\\nwalking. Oh, well, I told myself, it was a nice day for a stroll. This was no mere stroll for Naoko, though, judging from that walk.\\nShe turned right at Lidabashi, came out at the moat, crossed the\\nintersection at Jinbocho, climbed the hill at Ochanomizu and came out at Hongo. From there she followed the tram tracks to Komagome. It\\nwas a challenging route. By the time we reached Komagome, the sun\\nwas sinking and the day had become a soft spring evening. \"Where are we?\" asked Naoko, as if noticing our surroundings for the\\nfirst time. \"Komagome,\" I said. \"Didn’t you know? We made this big arc.\" \"Why did we come here?\" \"You brought us here. I was just following you.\" We went to a shop by the station for a bowl of noodles. Thirsty, I had\\na whole beer to myself. Neither of us said a word from the time we\\ngave our order to the time we finished eating. I was exhausted from all\\nthat walking, and she just sat there with her hands on the table,\\nmulling something over again. All the leisure spots were crowded on\\nthis warm Sunday, they were saying on the TV news. And we just\\nwalked from Yotsuya to Komagome, I said to myself. \"Well, \\nyou\\'re\\n in good shape,\" I said when I had finished my noodles.\\n\"Surprised?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I was a long distance runner at school, I\\'ll have you know. I used to\\ndo the 10,000 metres. And my father took me mountain climbing on\\nSundays ever since I can remember. You know our house - right there,\\nnext to the mountain. I\\'ve always had strong legs.\" \"It doesn\\'t show,\" I said. \"I know,\" she answered. \"Everybody thinks I\\'m this delicate little girl.\\nBut you can\\'t judge a book by its cover.\" To which she added a\\nmomentary smile. \"And that goes for me, too,\" I said. \"I\\'m worn out.\" \"Oh, I\\'m sorry. I\\'ve been dragging you around all day.\" \"Still, I\\'m glad\\nwe had a chance to talk. We\\'ve never done that before, just the two of\\nus,\" I said, trying without success to recall what we had talked \\nabout.\\nShe was playing with the ashtray on the table. \"I wonder. ..\" she began, \". . . if you wouldn’t mind ... I mean, if it really wouldn\\'t be any bother to you ... Do you think we could see\\neach other again? I know I don’t have any right to be asking you this.\"\\n\"Any right?\\n What do you mean by that?\" She blushed. My reaction t> her request might have been a little too\\nstrong. \"I don\\'t know ... I can’t really explain it,\" she said, tugging the sleeves\\nof her sweatshirt up over the elbows and down again. The soft hair on\\nher arms shone a lovely golden colour in the lights of the shop. \"I\\ndidn\\'t mean to say \"right’ exactly. I was looking for another way to put\\nit.\" Elbows on the table, she stared at the calendar on the wall, almost as\\nthough she were hoping to find the proper expression there. Failing,\\nshe sighed and closed her eyes and played with her hairslide. \"Never mind,\" I said. \"I think I know what you\\'re getting at. I\\'m not\\nsure how to put it, either.\" \"I can never say what I want to say,\" continued Naoko. \"It\\'s been like\\nthis for a while now. I try to say something, but all I get are the wrong\\nwords - the wrong words or the exact \\nopposite\\n words from what I\\nmean. I try to correct myself, and that only makes it worse. I lose track\\nof what I was trying to say to begin with. It\\'s like I\\'m split in two and\\nplaying tag with myself. One half is chasing the other half around this\\nbig, fat post. The \\nother\\n me has the right words, but this me can\\'t catch\\nher.\" She raised her face and looked into my eyes. \"Does this make\\nany sense to you?\" \"Everybody feels like that to some extent,\" I said. \"They\\'re trying to\\nexpress themselves and it bothers t can\\'t get it right.\" Naoko looked disappointed with my answer. \"No, that’s not it either,\"\\nshe said without further explanation \"Anyway, I’d be glad to see you again,\" I said. \"I\\'m always free on\\nSundays, and walking would be good for me.\" We boarded the Yamanote Line, and Naoko transferred to the Chuo\\nLine at Shinjuku. She was living in a tiny flat way out in the western suburb of Kokubunji. \"Tell me,\" she said as we parted. \"Has anything changed about the\\nway I talk?\" \"I think so,\" I said, \"but I\\'m not sure what. Tell you the truth, I know I\\nsaw you a lot back then, but I don’t remember talking to you much.\"\\n\"That\\'s true,\" she said. \"Anyway, can I call you on Saturday?\" \"Sure. I\\'ll be expecting to hear from you.\" I first met Naoko when I was in the sixth-form at school. She was also\\nin the sixth-form at a posh girls\\' school run by one of the Christian\\nmissions. The school was so refined you were considered unrefined if\\nyou studied too much. Naoko was the girlfriend of my best (and only)\\nfriend. Kizuki. The two of them had been close almost from birth,\\ntheir houses not 200 yards apart. As with most couples who have been together since childhood, there\\nwas a casual openness about the relationship of Kizuki and Naoko and\\nlittle sense that they wanted to be alone together. They were always\\nvisiting each other\\'s homes and eating or playing mah-jong with each\\nother\\'s families. I double-dated with them any number of times. Naoko\\nwould bring a school friend for me and the four of us would go to the\\nzoo or the pool or the cinema. The girls she brought were always\\npretty, but a little too refined for my taste. I got along better with the\\nsomewhat cruder girls from my own State school who were easier to\\ntalk to. I could never tell what was going on inside the pretty heads of\\nthe girls that Naoko brought along, and they probably couldn’t\\nunderstand me, either. After a while, Kizuki gave up trying to arrange dates for me, and\\ninstead the three of us would do things together. Kizuki and Naoko\\nand I: odd, but that was the most comfortable combination.\\nIntroducing a fourth person into the mix would always make things a\\nlittle awkward. We were like a TV talk show, with me the guest,\\nKizuki the talented host, and Naoko his assistant. He was good at occupying that central position. True, he had a sarcastic side that often\\nstruck people as arrogant, but in fact he was a considerate and fair-\\nminded person. He would distribute his remarks and jokes fairly to\\nNaoko and to me, taking care to see that neither of us felt left out. If\\none or the other stayed quiet too long, he would steer his conversation\\nin that direction and get the person to talk. It probably looked harder\\nthan it was: he knew how to monitor and adjust the air around him on\\na second-by-second basis. In addition, he had a rare talent for finding\\nthe interesting parts of someone\\'s generally uninteresting comments so\\nthat, while speaking to him, you felt you were an exceptionally\\ninteresting person with an exceptionally interesting life. And yet he was not the least bit sociable. I was his only real friend at\\nschool. I could never understand why such a smart and capable talker\\ndid not turn his talents to the broader world around him but remained\\nsatisfied to concentrate on our little trio. Nor could I understand why\\nhe picked me to be his friend. I was just an ordinary kid who liked to\\nread books and listen to music and didn\\'t stand out in any way that\\nwould prompt someone like Kizuki to pay attention to me. We hit it\\noff straight away, though. His father was a dentist, known for his\\nprofessional skill and his high fees. \"Want to double-date Sunday?\" he asked me just after we met. \"My\\ngirlfriend goes to a girls\\' school, and she\\'ll bring along a cute one for\\nyou.\" \"Sure,\" I said, and that was how I met Naoko. The three of us spent a lot of time together, but whenever Kizuki left\\nthe room, Naoko and I had trouble talking to each other. We never\\nknew what to talk \\nabout.\\n And in fact there was no topic of\\nconversation that we had in common. Instead of talking, we\\'d drink\\nwater or toy with something on the table and wait for Kizuki to come\\nback and start up the conversation again. Naoko was not particularly\\ntalkative, and I was more of a listener than a talker, so I felt uncomfortable when I was left alone with her. Not that we were\\nincompatible: we just had nothing to talk about. Naoko and I saw each other only once after Kizuki\\'s funeral. Two\\nweeks after the event, we met at a cafe to take care of some minor\\nmatter, and when that was finished we had nothing more to say. I tried\\nraising several different topics, but none of them led anywhere. And\\nwhen Naoko did talk, there was an edge to her voice. She seemed\\nangry with me, but I had no idea why. We never saw each other again\\nuntil that day a year later we happened to meet on the Chuo Line in\\nTokyo. Naoko might have been angry with me because I, not she, had been\\nthe last one to see Kizuki. That may not be the best way to put it, but I\\nmore or less understood how she felt. I would have swapped places\\nwith her if I could have, but finally, what had happened had happened,\\nand there was nothing I could do about it. It had been a nice afternoon in May. After lunch, Kizuki suggested we\\nskip classes and go play pool or something. I had no special interest in\\nmy afternoon classes, so together we left school, ambled down the hill\\nto a pool hall on the harbour, and played four games. When I won the\\nfirst, easy-going game, he became serious and won the next three.\\nThis meant I paid, according to our custom. Kizuki didn\\'t make a\\nsingle joke as we played, which was most unusual. We smoked\\nafterwards. \"Why so serious?\" I asked. \"I didn’t want to lose today,\" said Kizuki with a satisfied smile. He died that night in his garage. He led a rubber hose from the exhaust\\npipe of his N-360 to a window, taped over the gap in the window, and\\nrevved the engine. I have no idea how long it took him to die. His\\nparents had been out visiting a sick relative, and when they opened the\\ngarage to put their car away, he was already dead. His radio was\\ngoing, and a petrol station receipt was tucked under the windscreen wiper. Kizuki had left no suicide note, and had no motive that anyone could\\nthink of. Because I had been the last one to see him, I was called in for\\nquestioning by the police. I told the investigating officer that Kizuki\\nhad given no indication of what he was about to do, that he had been\\nexactly the same as always. The policeman had obviously formed a\\npoor impression of both Kizuki and me, as if it was perfectly natural\\nfor the kind of person who would skip classes and play pool to\\ncommit suicide. A small article in the paper brought the affair to a\\nclose. Kizuki\\'s parents got rid of his red N-360. For a time, a white\\nflower marked his school desk. In the ten months between Kizuki\\'s death and my exams, I was unable\\nto find a place for myself in the world around me. I started sleeping\\nwith one of the girls at school, but that didn’t last six months. Nothing\\nabout her really got to me. I applied to a private university in Tokyo,\\nthe kind of place with an entrance exam for which I wouldn’t have to\\nstudy much, and I passed without exhilaration. The girl asked me not\\nto go to Tokyo - \"It\\'s 500 miles from here!\" she pleaded - but I had to\\nget away from Kobe at any cost. I wanted to begin a new life where I\\ndidn’t know a soul. \"You don\\'t give a damn about me any more, now that you\\'ve slept\\nwith me,\" she said, crying. \"That\\'s not true,\" I insisted. \"I just need to get away from this town.\"\\nBut she was not prepared to understand me. And so we parted.\\nThinking about all the things that made her so much nicer than the\\nother girls at home, I sat on the bullet train to Tokyo feeling terrible\\nabout what I\\'d done, but there was no way to undo it. I would try to\\nforget her. There was only one thing for me to do when I started my new life in\\nthe dorm: stop taking everything so seriously; establish a proper\\ndistance between myself and everything else. Forget about green baize\\npool tables and red N-360s and white flowers on school desks; about smoke rising from tall crematorium chimneys, and chunky\\npaperweights in police interrogation rooms. It seemed to work at first.\\nI tried hard to forget, but there remained inside me a vague knot of air.\\nAnd as time went by, the knot began to take on a clear and simple\\nform, a form that I am able to put into words, like this: Death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life. It\\'s a cliche translated into words, but at the time I felt it not as words\\nbut as that knot of air inside me. Death exists - in a paperweight, in\\nfour red and white balls on a pool table - and we go on living and\\nbreathing it into our lungs like fine dust. Until that time, I had understood death as something entirely separate\\nfrom and independent of life. The hand of death is bound to take us, I\\nhad felt, but until the day it reaches out for us, it leaves us alone. This\\nhad seemed to me the simple, logical truth. Life is here, death is over\\nthere. I am here, not over there. The night Kizuki died, however, I lost the ability to see death (and\\nlife) in such simple terms. Death was not the opposite of life. It was\\nalready here, within my being, it had always been here, and no struggle would permit me to forget that.\\nWhen it took the 17-year-old Kizuki that night in May, death took me\\nas well. I lived through the following spring, at 18, with that knot of air in my\\nchest, but I straggled all the while against becoming serious.\\nBecoming serious was not the same thing as approaching the truth, I\\nsensed, however vaguely. But death was a fact, a serious fact, no\\nmatter how you looked at it. Stuck inside this suffocating\\ncontradiction, I went on endlessly spinning in circles. Those were\\nstrange days, now that I look back at them. In the midst of life,\\neverything revolved around death. Naoko called me the following Saturday, and that Sunday we had a\\ndate. I suppose I can call it a date. I can\\'t think of a better word for it. As before, we walked the streets. We stopped somewhere\\nfor coffee, walked some more, had dinner in the evening, and\\nsaid goodbye. Again, she talked only in snatches, but this didn\\'t seem\\nto bother her, and I made no special effort to keep the conversation\\ngoing. We talked about whatever came to mind - our daily routines,\\nour colleges; each a little fragment that led nowhere. We said nothing\\nat all about the past. And mainly, we walked - and walked, and\\nwalked. Fortunately, Tokyo is such a big city we could never have\\ncovered it all. We kept on walking like this almost every weekend. She would lead,\\nand I would follow close behind. Naoko had a variety of hairslides\\nand always wore them with her right ear exposed. I remember her\\nmost clearly this way, from the back. She would toy with her hairslide\\nwhenever she felt embarrassed by something. And she was always\\ndabbing at her mouth with a handkerchief. She did this whenever she\\nhad something to say. The more I observed these habits of hers, the\\nmore I came to like her. Naoko went to a girls\\' college on the rural western edge of Tokyo, a\\nnice little place famous for its teaching of English. Nearby was a narrow irrigation canal with clean, clear water, and\\nNaoko and I would often walk along its banks. Sometimes she would\\ninvite me up to her flat and cook for me. It never seemed to concern\\nher that the two of us were in such close quarters together. The room\\nwas small and neat and so lacking in frills that only the stockings\\ndrying in the comer by the window gave any hint that a girl lived there. She led a spare, simple life with hardly any friends. No one who\\nhad known her at school could have imagined her like this. Back then,\\nshe had dressed with real flair and surrounded herself with a million\\nfriends. When I saw her room, I realized that, like me, she had wanted\\nto go away to college and begin a new life far from anyone she knew.\\n\"Know why I chose this place?\" she said with a smile. \"Because\\nnobody from home was coming here. We were all supposed to go\\nsomewhere more chic. You know what I mean?\" My relationship with Naoko was not without its progress, though.\\nLittle by little, she grew more accustomed to me, and I to her. When\\nthe summer holidays ended and a new term started, Naoko began\\nwalking next to me as if it were the most natural thing in the world to\\ndo. She saw me as a friend now, I concluded, and walking side by side\\nwith such a beautiful girl was by no means painful for me. We kept\\nwalking all over Tokyo in the same meandering way, climbing hills,\\ncrossing rivers and railway lines, just walking and walking with no\\ndestination in mind. We forged straight ahead, as if our walking were\\na religious ritual meant to heal our wounded spirits. If it rained, we\\nused umbrellas, but in any case we walked. Then came autumn, and the dormitory grounds were buried in zelkova\\nleaves. The fragrance of a new season arrived when I put on my first\\npullover. Having worn out one pair of shoes, I bought some new suede\\nones. I can\\'t seem to recall what we talked about then. Nothing special, I\\nexpect. We continued to avoid any mention of the past and rarely\\nspoke about Kizuki. We could face each other over coffee cups in\\ntotal silence. Naoko liked to hear me tell stories about Storm Trooper. Once he had\\na date with a fellow student (a girl in geography, of course) but came\\nback in the early evening looking glum. \"Tell me, W W-Watanabe,\\nwhat do you talk about with g-g-girls?\" I don\\'t remember how I\\nanswered him, but he had picked the wrong person to ask. In July, somebody in the dorm had taken down Storm Trooper\\'s Amsterdam\\ncanal scene and put up a photo of the Golden Gate Bridge instead. He\\ntold me he wanted to know if Storm Trooper could masturbate to the\\nGolden Gate Bridge. \"He loved it,\" I reported later, which prompted\\nsomeone else to put up a picture of an iceberg. Each time the photo\\nchanged in his absence. Storm Trooper became upset. \"Who-who-who the hell is doing this?\" he asked. \"I wonder,\" I said. \"But what\\'s the difference? They\\'re all nice\\npictures. You should be grateful.\" \"Yeah, I s’pose so, but it’s weird.\" My stories of Storm Trooper always made Naoko laugh. Not many\\nthings succeeded in doing that, so I talked about him often, though I\\nwas not exactly proud of myself for using him this way. He just\\nhappened to be the youngest son in a not-too-wealthy family who had\\ngrown up a little too serious for his own good. Making maps was the\\none small dream of his one small life. Who had the right to make fun\\nof him for that? By then, however, Storm-Trooper jokes had become an indispensable\\nsource of dormitory talk, and there was no way for me to undo what I\\nhad done. Besides, the sight of Naoko’s smiling face had become my\\nown special source of pleasure. I went on supplying everyone with\\nnew stories. Naoko asked me one time - just once - if I had a girl I liked. I told her\\nabout the one I had left behind in Kobe. \"She was nice,\" I said. \"I\\nenjoyed sleeping with her, and I miss her every now and then, but\\nfinally, she didn’t move me. I don\\'t know, sometimes I think I’ve got\\nthis hard kernel in my heart, and nothing much can get inside it. I\\ndoubt if I can really love anybody.\" \"Have you ever \\nbeen\\n in love?\" Naoko asked. \"Never,\" I said. She didn\\'t ask me more than that. When autumn ended and cold winds began tearing through the city. Naoko would often walk pressed against my arm. I could sense her\\nbreathing through the thick cloth of her duffel coat. She would\\nentwine her arm with mine, or cram her hand in my pocket, or, when\\nit was really cold, cling tightly to my arm, shivering. None of this had\\nany special meaning. I just kept walking with my hands shoved in my\\npockets. Our rubber-soled shoes made hardly any sound on the\\npavement, except for the dry crackling when we trod on the broad,\\nwithered sycamore leaves. I felt sorry for Naoko whenever I heard that\\nsound. My arm was not the one she needed, but the arm of someone\\nelse. My warmth was not what she needed, but the warmth of\\nsomeone else. I felt almost guilty being me. As the winter deepened, the transparent clarity of Naoko\\'s eyes\\nseemed to increase. It was a clarity that had nowhere to go. Sometimes\\nNaoko would lock ter eyes on to mine for no apparent reason. She\\nseemed to be searching for something, and this would give me a\\nstrange, lonely, helpless sort of feeling. I wondered if she was trying to convey something to me, something\\nshe could not put into words - something prior to words that she could\\nnot grasp within herself and which therefore had no hope of ever\\nturning into words. Instead, she would fiddle with her hairslide, dab at\\nthe comers of her mouth with a handkerchief, or look into my eyes in\\nthat meaningless way. I wanted to hold her tight when she did these\\nthings, but I would hesitate and hold back. I was afraid I might hurt\\nher. And so the two of us kept walking the streets of Tokyo, Naoko\\nsearching for words in space. The guys in the dorm would always ease me when I got a call from\\nNaoko or went out on a Sunday morning. They assumed, naturally\\nenough, that I had found a girlfriend. There was no way to explain the\\ntruth to them, and no need to explain it, so I let them think what they\\nwanted to. I had to face a barrage of stupid questions in the evening -\\nwhat position had we used? What was she like down there? What\\ncolour underwear had she been wearing that day? I gave them the answers they wanted. And so I went from 18 to 19. Each day the sun would rise and set, the\\nflag would be raised and lowered. Every Sunday I would have a date\\nwith my dead friend\\'s girl. I had no idea what I was doing or what I\\nwas going to do. For my courses I would read Claudel and Racine and\\nEisenstein. but they meant almost nothing to me. I made no friends at\\nthe lectures, and hardly knew anyone in the dorm. The others in the\\ndorm thought I wanted to be a writer because I was always alone with\\na book, but I had no such ambition. There was nothing I wanted to be. I tried to talk 4>out this feeling with Naoko. She, at least, would be\\nable to understand what I was feeling with some degree of precision, I\\nthought. But I could never find the words to express myself. Strange, I\\nseemed to have caught her word-searching sickness. On Saturday nights I would sit by the phone in the lobby, waiting for\\nNaoko to call. Most of the others were out, so the lobby was usually\\ndeserted. I would stare at the grains of light suspended in that silent\\nspace, struggling to see into my own heart. What did I want? And\\nwhat did others want from me? But I could never find the answers.\\nSometimes I would reach out and try to grasp the grains of light, but\\nmy fingers touched nothing. I read a lot, but not a lot of different books: I like to read my\\nfavourites again and again. Back then it was Truman Capote, John\\nUpdike, F. Scott Fitzgerald. Raymond Chandler, but I didn’t see\\nanyone else in my lectures or the dorm reading writers like that. They\\nliked Kazumi Takahashi, Kenzaburo Oe, Yukio Mishima, or\\ncontemporary French novelists, which was another reason I didn’t\\nhave much to say to anybody but kept to myself and my books. With\\nmy eyes closed, I would touch a familiar book and draw its fragrance\\ndeep inside me. This was enough to make me happy. At 18 my favourite book was John Updike\\'s \\nThe Centaur,\\n but after I\\nhad read it a number of times, it began to lose some of its initial lustre and yielded first place to \\nThe Great Gatsby. Gatsby\\n stayed in first\\nplace for a long time after that. I would pull it off the shelf when the\\nmood hit me and read a section at random. It never once disappointed\\nme. There wasn\\'t a boring page in the whole book. I wanted to tell\\npeople what a wonderful novel it was, but no one around me had read\\nThe Great Gatsby\\n or was likely to. Urging others to read F Scott\\nFitzgerald, although not a reactionary act, was not something one\\ncould do in 1968. When I did finally meet the one person in my world who had read\\nGatsby,\\n he and I became friends because of it. His name was\\nNagasawa. He was two years older than me, and because he was doing\\nlegal studies at the prestigious Tokyo University, he was on the fast\\ntrack to national leadership. We lived in the same dorm and knew\\neach other only by sight, until one day when I was reading \\nGatsby\\n in a\\nsunny spot in the dining hall. He sat down next to me and asked what I\\nwas reading. When I told him, he asked if I was enjoying it. \"This is\\nmy third time,\" I said, \"and every time I find something new that I like\\neven more than the last.\" \"This man says he has read \\nThe Great Gatsby\\n three times,\" he said as\\nif to himself. \"Well, any friend of \\nGatsby\\n is a friend of mine.\" And so we became friends. This happened in October. The better I got to know Nagasawa, the stranger he seemed. I had met\\na lot of weird people in my day, but none as strange as Nagasawa. He\\nwas a far more voracious reader than me, but he made it a rule never\\nto touch a book \\nby any\\n author who had not been dead at least 30 years.\\n\"That\\'s the only kind of book I can trust,\" he said. \"It\\'s not that I don’t believe in contemporary literature,\" he added, \"but\\nI don\\'t want to waste valuable time reading any book that has not had\\nthe baptism of time. Life is too short.\" \"What kind of authors do you like?\" I asked, speaking in respectful\\ntones to this man two years my senior. \"Balzac, Dante, Joseph Conrad, Dickens,\" he answered without hesitation. \"Not exactly fashionable.\" \"That\\'s why I read them. If you only read the books that everyone else\\nis reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking. That\\'s\\nthe world of hicks and slobs. Real people would be ashamed of\\nthemselves doing that. Haven\\'t you noticed, Watanabe? You and I are\\nthe only real ones in this dorm. The other guys are crap.\" This took me off guard. \"How can you say that?\" \"\\'Cause it\\'s true. I know. I can see it. It\\'s like we have marks on our\\nforeheads. And besides, we\\'ve both read \\nThe Great Gatsby.\" I did some quick calculating. \"But Fitzgerald\\'s only been dead 28\\nyears,\" I said. \"So what? Two years? Fitzgerald\\'s advanced.\" No one else in the dorm knew that Nagasawa was a secret reader of\\nclassic novels, nor would it have mattered if they had. Nagasawa was\\nknown for being smart. He breezed into Tokyo University, he got\\ngood marks, he would take the Civil Service Exam, join the Foreign\\nMinistry, and become a diplomat. He came from a wealthy family. His\\nfather owned a big hospital in Nagoya, and his brother had also\\ngraduated from Tokyo, gone on to medical school, and would one day\\ninherit the hospital. Nagasawa always had plenty of money in his\\npocket, and he carried himself with real dignity. People treated him\\nwith respect, even the dorm Head. When he asked someone to do\\nsomething, the person would do it without protest. There was no\\nchoice in the matter. Nagasawa had a certain inborn quality that drew people to him and\\nmade them follow him. He knew how to stand at the head of the pack,\\nto assess the situation, to give precise and tactful instructions that\\nothers would obey. Above his head hung an aura that revealed his\\npowers like an angel\\'s halo, the mere sight of which would inspire awe\\nin people for this superior being. Which is why it shocked everyone that Nagasawa chose me, a person with no distinctive qualities, to be\\nhis special friend. People I hardly knew treated me with a certain\\nrespect because of it, but what they did not seem to realize was that\\nthe reason for my having been chosen was a simple one, namely that I\\ntreated Nagasawa with none of the adulation he received from other\\npeople. I had a definite interest in the strange, complex aspects of his\\nnature, but none of those other things - his good marks, his aura, his\\nlooks - impressed me. This must have been something new for him.\\nThere were sides to Nagasawa\\'s personality that conflicted in the\\nextreme. Even I would be moved by his kindness at times, but he\\ncould just as well be malicious and cruel. He was both a spirit of\\namazing loftiness and an irredeemable man of the gutter. He could\\ncharge forward, the optimistic leader, even as his heart writhed in a\\nswamp of loneliness. I saw these paradoxical qualities of his from the\\nstart, and I could never understand why they weren\\'t just as obvious to\\neveryone else. He lived in his own special hell. Still, I think I always managed to view him in the most favourable\\nlight. His greatest virtue was his honesty. Not only would he never lie,\\nhe would always acknowledge his shortcomings. He never tried to\\nhide things that might embarrass him. And where I was concerned, he\\nwas unfailingly kind and supportive. Had he not been, my life in the\\ndorm would have been far more unpleasant than it was. Still, I never\\nonce opened my heart to him, and in that sense my relationship with\\nNagasawa stood in stark contrast to me and Kizuki. The first time I\\nsaw Nagasawa drunk and tormenting a girl, I promised myself never,\\nunder any circumstances, to open myself up to him. There were several \"Nagasawa Legends\" that circulated throughout\\nthe dorm. According to one, he supposedly once ate three slugs.\\nAnother gave him a huge penis and had him sleeping with more than\\n100 girls. The slug story was true. He told me so himself. \"Three big mothers,\" he said. \"Swallowed \\'em whole.\" \"What the hell for?\" \"Well, it happened the first year I came to live here,\" he said. \"There\\nwas some shit between the first-years and the third-years. Started in\\nApril and finally came to a head in September. As first-year\\nrepresentative I went to work things out with the third-years. Real\\nright-wing arseholes. They had these wooden kendo swords, and\\n\"working things out\\' was probably the last thing they wanted to do. So\\nI said. \\'All right, let’s put an end to this. Do what you want to me, but\\nleave the other guys alone.’ So they said. \"OK. let’s see you swallow a\\ncouple of slugs.’ \"Fine,\\n1\\n1 said, \"Let’s have ’em.\\' The bastards went out\\nand got three huge slugs. And I swallowed ’em.\" \"What was it like?\" \"What was it like?’ You have to swallow one yourself. The way it\\nslides down your throat and into your stomach ... it’s cold, and it\\nleaves this disgusting aftertaste ... yuck, I get chills just thinking about\\nit. I wanted to puke but I fought it. I mean, if I had puked ’em up, I would have had to swallow\\n’em all over again. So I kept ’em down. All three of ’em.\" \"Then what happened?\" \"I went back to my room and drank a bucket of salt water. What else could I do?\" \"Yeah, I guess so.\" \"But after that, nobody could say a thing to me. Not even the third-years. I’m the only guy in this place who can swallow three slugs.\" \"I bet you are.\" Finding out about his penis size was easy enough. I just went to the\\ndorm\\'s communal shower with him. Fie had a big one, all right. But\\n100 girls was probably an exaggeration. \"Maybe 75,\" he said. \"I can\\'t\\nremember them all, but I\\'m sure it’s at least 70.\" When I told him I had slept with only one, he said. \"Oh, we can fix that, easy. Come with me\\nnext time. I\\'ll get you one easy as that.\" I didn’t believe him, but he turned out to be right. It was easy. Almost\\ntoo easy, with all the excitement of flat beer. We went to some kind of\\nbar in Shibuya or Shinjuku (he had Hs favourites), found a pair of\\ngirls (the world was full of pairs of girls), talked to them, drank, went\\nto a hotel, and had sex with them. He was a great talker. Not that he\\nhad anything great to say, but girls would get carried away listening to\\nhim, they\\'d drink too much and end up sleeping with him. I guess they\\nenjoyed being with somebody so nice and handsome and clever. And\\nthe most amazing thing was that, just because I was with him, I\\nseemed to become equally fascinating to them. Nagasawa would urge\\nme to talk, and girls would respond to me with the same smiles of\\nadmiration they offered him. He worked his magic, a real talent he had\\nthat impressed me every time. Compared with Nagasawa, Kizuki\\'s\\nconversational gifts were child\\'s play. This was a completely different\\nlevel of accomplishment. As much as I found myself caught up in\\nNagasawa\\'s power, though, I still missed Kizuki. I felt a new\\nadmiration for his sincerity. Whatever talents he had he would share\\nwith Naoko and me alone, while Nagasawa was bent on disseminating\\nhis considerable gifts to all around him. Not that he was dying to sleep\\nwith the girls he found: it was just a game to him. I was not too crazy about sleeping with girls I didn’t know. It was an\\neasy way to take care of my sex drive of course, and I did enjoy all the\\nholding and touching, but I hated the morning after. I\\'d wake up and\\nfind this strange girl sleeping next to me, and the room would reek of\\nalcohol, and the bed and the lighting and the curtains had that special\\n\"love hotel\" garishness, and my head would be in a hungover fog.\\nThen the girl would wake up and start groping around for her knickers and while she was putting on her stockings she\\'d say something like,\\n\"I hope you used one last night. It’s the worst day of the month for\\nme.\" Then she’d sit in front of a mirror and start grumbling about her\\naching head or her uncooperative make-up while she redid her lipstick\\nor attached her false eyelashes. I would have preferred not to spend\\nthe whole night with them, but you can’t worry about a midnight\\ncurfew while you\\'re seducing women (which runs counter to the laws\\nof physics anyway), so I’d go out with an overnight pass. This meant I\\nhad to stay put until morning and go back to the dorm filled with self-\\nloathing and disillusionment, sunlight stabbing my eyes, mouth coated\\nwith sand, head belonging to someone else. When I had slept with three or four girls this way, I asked Nagasawa,\\n\"After you\\'ve done this 70 times, doesn\\'t it begin to seem kind of\\npointless?\" \"That proves you\\'re a decent human being,\" he said. \"Congratulations.\\nThere is absolutely nothing to be gained from sleeping with one\\nstrange woman after another. It just tires you out and makes you\\ndisgusted with yourself. It\\'s the same for me.\" \"So why the hell do you keep it up?\" \"Hard to say. Hey, you know that thing Dostoevsky wrote on\\ngambling? It\\'s like that. When you\\'re surrounded by endless\\npossibilities, one of the hardest things you can do is pass them up. See\\nwhat I mean?\" \"Sort of.\" \"Look. The sun goes down. The girls come out and drink. They\\nwander around, looking for something. I can give them that\\nsomething. It\\'s the easiest thing in the world, like drinking water from\\na tap. Before you know it. I\\'ve got \\'em down. It\\'s what they expect.\\nThat\\'s what I mean by possibility. It\\'s all around you. How can you\\nignore it? You have a certain ability and the opportunity to use it: can\\nyou keep your mouth shut and let it pass?\" \"I don’t know. I\\'ve never been in a situation like that,\" I said with a smile. \"I can\\'t imagine what it\\'s like.\" \"Count your blessings,\" Nagasawa said. His womanizing was the reason Nagasawa lived in a dorm despite his\\naffluent background. Worried that Nagasawa would do nothing else if\\nallowed to live alone in Tokyo, his father had compelled him to live\\nall four years at university in the donnitory. Not that it mattered much\\nto Nagasawa. He was not going to let a few rules bother him.\\nWhenever he felt like it, he would get an overnight permission and go\\ngirl-hunting or spend the night at his girlfriend\\'s flat. These\\npermissions were not easy to get, but for him they were like free\\npasses - and for me, too, as long as he did the asking. Nagasawa did have a steady girlfriend, one he’d been going out with\\nsince his first year. Her name was Hatsumi, and she was the same age\\nas Nagasawa. I had met her a few times and found her to be very nice.\\nShe didn\\'t have the kind of looks that immediately attracted attention,\\nand in fact she was so ordinary that when I first met her I had to\\nwonder why Nagasawa couldn\\'t do better, but anyone who talked to\\nher took an immediate liking to her. Quiet, intelligent, funny, caring,\\nshe always dressed with immaculate good taste. I liked her a lot and\\nknew that if I could have a girlfriend like Hatsumi, I wouldn\\'t be\\nsleeping around with a bunch of easy marks. She liked me, too, and\\ntried hard to fix me up with a first-year in her club so we could\\ndouble-date, but I would make up excuses to keep from repeating past\\nmistakes. Hatsumi went to the absolute top girls\\' college in the\\ncountry, and there was no way I was going to be able to talk to one of\\nthose super-rich princesses. Hatsumi had a pretty good idea that Nagasawa was sleeping around,\\nbut she never complained to him. She was seriously in love, but she\\nnever made demands. \"I don\\'t deserve a girl like Hatsumi,\" Nagasawa once said to me. I had\\nto agree with him. That winter I found a part-time job in a little record shop in Shinjuku.\\nIt didn’t pay much, but the work was easy - just watching the place\\nthree nights a week - and they let me buy records cheap. For\\nChristmas I bought Naoko a Henry Mancini album with a track of her\\nfavourite \"Dear Heart\". I wrapped it myself and added a bright red\\nribbon. She gave me a pair of woollen gloves she had knitted. The\\nthumbs were a little short, but they did keep my hands warm. \"Oh, I\\'m sorry,” she said, blushing, \"What a bad job!\" \"Don\\'t worry, they fit fine,\" I said, holding my gloved hands out to\\nher. \"Well, at least you won\\'t have to shove your hands in your pockets, I\\nguess.\" Naoko didn’t go home to Kobe for the winter break. I stayed in Tokyo,\\ntoo, working in the record shop right up to the end of the year. I didn\\'t\\nhave anything especially fun to do in Kobe or anyone I wanted to see.\\nThe dorm\\'s dining hall was closed for the holiday, so I went to\\nNaoko\\'s flat for meals. On New Year\\'s Eve we had rice cakes and\\nsoup like everybody else. A lot happened in late January and February that year, 1969. At the end of January, Storm Trooper went to bed with a raging fever.\\nWhich meant I had to stand up Naoko that day. I had gone to a lot of\\ntrouble to get my hands on some free tickets for a concert. She had\\nbeen especially eager to go because the orchestra was performing one\\nof her favourites: Brahms\\' Fourth Symphony. But with Storm Trooper\\ntossing around in bed on the verge of what looked like an agonizing\\ndeath, I couldn’t just leave him, and I couldn’t find anyone stupid\\nenough to nurse him in my place. I bought some ice and used several\\nlayers of plastic bags to hold it on his forehead, wiped his sweating\\nbrow with cold towels, took his temperature every hour, and even\\nchanged his vest for him. The fever stayed high for a day, but the\\nfollowing morning he jumped out of bed and started exercising as\\nthough nothing had happened. His temperature was completely normal. It was hard to believe he was a human being. \"Weird,\" said Storm Trooper. \"I\\'ve never mn a fever in my life.\" It\\nwas almost as if he were blaming me. This made me mad. \"But you \\ndid\\n have a fever,\" I insisted, showing\\nhim the two wasted tickets. \"Good thing they were free,\" he said. I wanted to grab his radio and\\nthrow it out of the window, but instead I went back to bed with a\\nheadache. It snowed several times in February. Near the end of the month I got into a stupid fight with one of the\\nthird-years on my floor and punched him. He hit his head against the\\nconcrete wall, but he wasn\\'t badly injured, and Nagasawa straightened\\nthings out for me. Still, I was called into the dorm Head\\'s office and\\ngiven a warning, after which I grew increasingly uncomfortable living\\nin the dormitory. The academic year ended in March, but I came up a few credits short.\\nMy exam results were mediocre - mostly \"C\"s and \"D\"s with a few\\n\"B\"s. Naoko had all the grades she needed to begin the spring term of\\nher second year. We had completed one full cycle of the seasons. Halfway through April Naoko turned 20. She was seven months older\\nthan I was, my own birthday being in November. There was\\nsomething strange about her becoming 20. I. felt as if the only thing\\nthat made sense, whether for Naoko or for me, was to keep going back\\nand forth between 18 and 19. After 18 would come 19, and after 19,\\n18, of course. But she turned 20. And in the autumn, I would do the\\nsame. Only the dead stay 17 for ever. It rained on her birthday. After lectures I bought a cake nearby and\\ntook the tram to her flat. \"We ought to have a celebration,\" I said. I\\nprobably would have wanted the same thing if our positions had been\\nreversed. It must be hard to pass your twentieth birthday alone. The\\ntram had been packed and had pitched so wildly that by the time I arrived at Naoko\\'s room the cake was looking more like the Roman\\nColosseum than anything else. Still, once I had managed to stand up\\nthe 20 candles I had brought along, light them, close the curtains and\\nturn out the lights, we had the makings of a birthday party. Naoko\\nopened a bottle of wine. We drank, had some cake, and enjoyed a\\nsimple dinner. \"I don’t know, it\\'s stupid being 20,\" she said. \"I\\'m just not ready. It\\nfeels weird. Like somebody\\'s pushing me from behind.\" \"I\\'ve got seven months to get ready,\" I said with a laugh. \"You\\'re so lucky! Still 19!\" said Naoko with a hint of envy. While we ate I told her about Storm Trooper\\'s new jumper. Until then\\nhe had had only one, a navy-blue pullover, so two was a big move for\\nhim. The jumper itself was a nice one, red and black with a knitted\\ndeer motif, but on him it made everybody laugh. He couldn’t work out\\nwhat was going on. \"W what\\'s so funny, Watanabe?\" he asked, sitting next to me in the\\ndining hall. \"Is something stuck to my forehead?\" \"Nothing,\" I said, trying to keep a straight face. \"There\\'s nothing\\nfunny. Nice jumper.\" \"Thanks,\" he said, beaming. Naoko loved the story. \\n\"I have\\n to meet him,\" she said. \"Just once.\" \"No way,\" I said. \"You’d laugh in his face.\" \"You think so?\" \"I\\'d bet on it. I see him every day, and still I can\\'t help laughing\\nsometimes.\" We cleared the table and sat on the floor, listening to music and\\ndrinking the rest of the wine. She drank two glasses in the time it took\\nme to finish one. Naoko was unusually talkative that night. She told me about her\\nchildhood, her school, her family. Each episode was a long one,\\nexecuted with the painstaking detail of a miniature. I was amazed at\\nthe power of her memory, but as I sat listening it began to dawn on me\\nthat there was something wrong with the way she was telling these stories: something strange, warped even. Each tale had its own\\ninternal logic, but the link from one to the next was odd. Before you\\nknew it, story A had turned into story B, which had been contained in\\nA, and then came C from something in B, with no end in sight. I found\\nthings to say in response at first, but after a while I stopped trying. I\\nput on a record, and when it ended I lifted the needle and put on\\nanother. After the last record I went back to the first. She only had six.\\nThe cycle started with \\nSgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band\\n and\\nended with Bill Evans\\' \\nWaltz for Debbie.\\n Rain fell past the window.\\nTime moved slowly. Naoko went on talking by herself. It eventually dawned on me what was wrong: Naoko was taking great\\ncare as she spoke not to touch on certain things. One of those things\\nwas Kizuki, of course, but there was more than Kizuki. And though\\nshe had certain subjects she was determined to avoid, she went on\\nendlessly and in incredible detail about the most trivial, inane things. I\\nhad never heard her speak with such intensity before, and so I did not\\ninterrupt her. Once the clock struck eleven, though, I began to feel nervous. She had\\nbeen talking non-stop for more than four hours. I had to worry about\\nthe last train, and my midnight curfew. I saw my chance and cut in.\\n\"Time for the troops to go home,\" I said, looking at my watch. \"Last\\ntrain\\'s coming.\" My words did not seem to reach her. Or, if they did, she was unable to\\ngrasp their meaning. She clamped her mouth shut for a split second,\\nthen went on with her story. I gave up and. shifting to a more\\ncomfortable position, drank what was left of the second bottle of wine.\\nI thought I had better let her talk herself out. The curfew and the last\\ntrain would have to take care of themselves. She did not go on for long, though. Before I knew it, she had stopped\\ntalking. The ragged end of the last word she spoke seemed to float in\\nthe air, where it had been torn off. She had not actually finished what\\nshe was saying. Her words had simply evaporated. She had been trying to go on, but had come up against nothing. Something was gone\\nnow, and I was probably the one who had destroyed it. My words\\nmight have finally reached her, taken their time to be understood, and\\nobliterated whatever energy it was that had kept her talking so long.\\nLips slightly parted, she turned her half focused eyes on mine. She\\nlooked like some kind of machine that had been humming along until\\nsomeone pulled the plug. Her eyes appeared clouded, as if covered by\\nsome thin, translucent membrane. \"Sorry to interrupt,\" I said, \"but it\\'s getting late, and ...\" One big tear spilled from her eye, ran down her cheek and splattered\\nonto a record jacket. Once that first tear broke free, the rest followed\\nin an unbroken stream. Naoko bent forwards on all fours on the floor\\nand, pressing her palms to the mat, began to cry with the force of a\\nperson vomiting. Never in my life had I seen anyone cry with such\\nintensity. I reached out and placed a hand on her trembling shoulder.\\nThen, all but instinctively, I took her in my arms. Pressed against me,\\nher whole body trembling, she continued to cry without a sound. My\\nshirt became damp - then soaked - with her tears and hot breath. Soon\\nher fingers began to move across my back as if in search of\\nsomething, some important thing that had always been there.\\nSupporting her weight with my left arm, I used my right hand to\\ncaress her soft, straight hair. And I waited. In that position, I waited\\nfor Naoko to stop crying. And I went on waiting. But Naoko\\'s crying\\nnever stopped. I slept with Naoko that night. Was it the right thing to do? I can\\'t tell.\\nEven now, almost 20 years later, I can\\'t be sure. I suppose I\\'ll never\\nknow. But at the time, it was all I could do. She was in a heightened\\nstate of tension and confusion, and she made it clear she wanted me to\\ngive her release. I turned the lights down and began, one piece at a\\ntime, with the gentlest touch I could manage, to remove her clothes.\\nThen I undressed. It was warm enough, that rainy April night, for us to\\ncling to each other\\'s nakedness without a sense of chill. We explored each other\\'s bodies in the darkness without words. I kissed her and\\nheld her soft breasts in my hands. She clutched at my erection. Her\\nopening was warm and wet and asking for me. And yet, when I went inside her, Naoko tensed with pain. Was this her\\nfirst time? I asked, and she nodded. Now it was my turn to be\\nconfused. I had assumed that Naoko had been sleeping with Kizuki all\\nthat time. I went in as far as I could and stayed that way for a long\\ntime, holding Naoko, without moving. And then, as she began to seem\\ncalmer, I allowed myself to move inside her, taking a long time to\\ncome to climax, with slow, gentle movements. Her arms tightened\\naround me at the end. when at last she broke her silence. Her cry was\\nthe saddest sound of orgasm I had ever heard. When everything had ended, I asked Naoko why she had never slept\\nwith Kizuki. This was a mistake. No sooner had I asked the question\\nthan she took her arms from me and started crying soundlessly again. I\\npulled her bedding from the closet, spread it on the mat floor, and put\\nher in beneath the covers. Smoking, I watched the endless April rain\\nbeyond the window. The rain had stopped when morning came. Naoko was sleeping with\\nher back to me. Or maybe she hadn\\'t slept at all. Whether she was\\nawake or asleep, all words had left her lips, and her body now seemed\\nstiff, almost frozen. I tried several times to talk to her, but she would\\nnot answer or move. I stared for a long time at her naked shoulder, but\\nin the end I lost all hope of eliciting a response and decided to get up.\\nThe floor was still littered with record jackets, glasses, wine bottles\\nand the ashtray I had been using. Half the caved-in birthday cake\\nremained on the table. It was as if time had come to a halt. I picked up\\nthe things off the floor and drank two glasses of water at the sink. On\\nNaoko\\'s desk lay a dictionary and a French verb chart. On the wall\\nabove the desk hung a calendar, one without an illustration or photo of\\nany kind, just the numbers of the days of the month. There were no\\nmemos or marks written next to any of the dates. I picked up my clothes and dressed. The chest of my shirt was still\\ndamp and chilly. It had Naoko\\'s smell. On the notepad lying on the\\ndesk I wrote: \\nI\\'d like to have a good long talk with you once you\\'ve\\ncalmed down. Please call me soon. Happy Birthday.\\n I took one last look at Naoko\\'s shoulder, stepped outside and\\nquietly shut the door. No call came even after a week had passed. Naoko\\'s house had no\\nsystem for calling people to the phone, and so on Sunday morning I\\ntook the train out to Kokubunji. She wasn\\'t there, and her name had\\nbeen removed from the door. The windows and storm shutters were\\nclosed tight. The manager told me that Naoko had moved out three\\ndays earlier. He had no idea where she had moved to. I went back to the dorm and wrote Naoko a long letter addressed to\\nher home in Kobe. Wherever she was, they would forward it to her at\\nleast. I gave her an honest account of my feelings. There was a lot I still\\ndidn\\'t understand, I said, and though I was trying hard to understand, it\\nwould take time. Where I would be once that time had gone by, it was\\nimpossible for me to say now, which is why it was impossible for me\\nto make promises or demands, or to set down pretty words. For one\\nthing, we knew too little of each other. If, however, she would grant\\nme the time, I would give it my best effort, and the two of us would\\ncome to know each other better. In any case, I wanted to see her again\\nand have a good long talk. When I lost Kizuki, I lost the one person to\\nwhom I could speak honestly of my feelings, and I imagined it had\\nbeen the same for Naoko. She and I had needed each other more than\\neither of us knew. Which was no doubt why our relationship had taken\\nsuch a major detour and become, in a sense, warped. \\nI probably\\nshould not have done what I did, and yet I believe that it was all I\\ncould do. The warmth and closeness I felt for you at that moment was\\nsomething I have never experienced before. I need you to answer this letter. Whatever that answer may be, I need to have it. No answer came. Something inside me had dropped away, and nothing came in to fill\\nthe empty cavern. There was an abnormal lightness to my body, and\\nsounds had a hollow echo to them. I went to lectures more faithfully\\nthan ever. They were boring, and I never talked to my fellow students,\\nbut I had nothing else to do. I would sit by myself in the very front\\nrow of the lecture hall, speak to no one and eat alone. I stopped\\nsmoking. The student strike started at the end of May. \"Dismantle the\\nUniversity!\" they all screamed. Go ahead, do it, I thought. Dismantle\\nit. Tear it apart. Crush it to bits. I don\\'t give a damn. It would be a\\nbreath of fresh air. I\\'m ready for anything. I\\'ll help if necessary. Just\\ngo ahead and do it. With the campus blockaded and lectures suspended, I started to work\\nat a delivery company. Sitting with the driver, loading and unloading\\nlorries, that kind of stuff. It was tougher than I thought. At first I could\\nhardly get out of bed in the morning with the pain. The pay was good,\\nthough, and as long as I kept my body moving I could forget about the\\nemptiness inside. I worked on the lorries five days a week, and three\\nnights a week I continued my job at the record shop. Nights without\\nwork I spent with whisky and books. Storm Trooper wouldn\\'t touch\\nwhisky and couldn’t stand the smell, so when I was sprawled on my\\nbed drinking it straight, he\\'d complain that the fumes made it\\nimpossible for him to study and ask me to take my bottle outside. \"You\\n get the hell out,\" I growled. \"But you know drinking in the dorm is a-a-against the rules.\" \"I don\\'t give a shit. \\nYou\\n get out.\" He stopped complaining, but now I was annoyed. I went to the roof\\nand drank alone. In June I wrote Naoko another long letter, addressing it again to her\\nhouse in Kobe. It said pretty much the same thing as the first one, but at the end I added: \\nWaiting for your answer is one of the most painful things I have ever been through. At\\nleast let me know whether or not I hurt you.\\n When I posted it, I felt as if the cavern inside me had grown again. That June I went out with Nagasawa twice again to sleep with girls. It\\nwas easy both times. The first girl put up a terrific struggle when I\\ntried to get her undressed and into the hotel bed, but when I began\\nreading alone because it just wasn\\'t worth it, she came over and started\\nnuzzling me. Aid after I had done it with the second one, she started\\nasking me all kinds of personal questions - how many girls had I slept\\nwith? Where was I from? Which university did I go to? What kind of\\nmusic did I like? Had I ever read any novels by Osarnu Dazai? Where\\nwould I like to go if I could travel abroad? Did I think her nipples\\nwere too big? I made up some answers and went to sleep, but next\\nmorning she said she wanted to have breakfast with me, and she kept\\nup the stream of questions over the tasteless eggs and toast and coffee. What kind of work did my\\nfather do? Did I get good marks at school? What month was I born?\\nHad I ever eaten frogs? She was giving me a headache, so as soon as\\nwe had finished eating I said I had to go to work. \"Will I ever see you again?\" she asked with a sad look. \"Oh, I\\'m sure we\\'ll meet again somewhere before long,\" I said, and\\nleft. What the hell am I doing? I started wondering as soon as I was\\nalone, feeling disgusted with myself. And yet it was all \\nI could\\n do. My\\nbody was hungering for women. All the time I was sleeping with\\nthose girls I thought about Naoko: the white shape of her naked body\\nin the darkness, her sighs, the sound of the rain. The more I thought\\nabout these things, the hungrier my body grew. I went up to the roof\\nwith my whisky and asked myself where I thought I was heading.\\nFinally, at the beginning of July, a letter came from Naoko. A short\\nletter. Please forgive me for not answering sooner. But try to understand. It\\ntook me a very long time before I was in any condition to write, and I\\nhave started this letter at least ten times. Writing is a painful process\\nfor me. Let me begin with my conclusion. I have decided to take a year off\\nfrom college. Officially, it\\'s a leave of absence, but I suspect that I will\\nnever be going back. This will no doubt come as a surprise to you, but\\nin fact I had been thinking about doing this for a very long time. I tried\\na few times to mention it to you, but I was never able to make myself\\nbegin. I was afraid even to pronounce the words. Try not to get so worked up about things. Whatever happened - or\\ndidn\\'t happen - the end result would have been the same. This may not\\nbe the best way to put it, and I\\'m sorry if it hurts you. What I am\\ntrying to tell you is, I don’t want you to blame yourself for what\\nhappened with me. It is something I have to take on all by myself. I\\nhad been putting it off for more than a year, and so I ended up making\\nthings very difficult for you. There is probably no way to put it off any\\nlonger. After I moved out of my flat, I came back to my family\\'s house in\\nKobe and was seeing a doctor for a while. He tells me there is a place\\nin the hills outside Kyoto that would be perfect for me, and I\\'m\\nthinking of spending a little time there. It\\'s not exactly a hospital, more\\na sanatorium kind of thing with a far freer style of treatment. I\\'ll leave\\nthe details for another letter. What I need now is to rest my nerves in a\\nquiet place cut off from the world. I feel grateful in my own way for the year of companionship you gave\\nme. Please believe that much even if you believe nothing else. You are\\nnot the one who hurt me. I myself am the one who did that. This is\\ntruly how I feel. For now, however, I am not prepared to see you. It\\'s not that I don’t\\nwant\\n to see you: I\\'m amply not prepared for it. The moment I feel\\nready, I will write to you. Perhaps then we can get to know each other better. As you say, this is probably what we should do: get to know\\neach other better. Goodbye. I read Naoko\\'s letter again and again, and each time I would be filled\\nwith that same unbearable sadness I used to feel whenever Naoko\\nherself stared into my eyes. I had no way to deal with it, no place I\\ncould take it to or hide it away. Like the wind passing over my body,\\nit had neither shape nor weight nor could I wrap myself in it. Objects\\nin the scene would drift past me, but the words they spoke never\\nreached my ears. I continued to spend my Saturday nights sitting in the hall. There was\\nno hope of a phone call, but I didn\\'t know what else to do with the\\ntime. I would switch on a baseball game and pretend to watch it as I\\ncut the empty space between me and the television set in two, then cut\\neach half in two again, over and over, until I had fashioned a space\\nsmall enough to hold in my hand. I would switch the set off at ten, go back to my room, and go to sleep. At the end of the month. Storm Trooper gave me a firefly. It was in an\\ninstant coffee jar with air holes in the lid and containing some blades\\nof grass and a little water. In the bright room the firefly looked like\\nsome kind of ordinary black insect you’d find by a pond somewhere,\\nbut Storm Trooper insisted it was the real thing. \"I know a firefly\\nwhen I see one,\" he said, and I had no reason or basis to disbelieve\\nhim. \"Fine,\" I said. \\'It’s a firefly.\" It had a sleepy look on its face, but it\\nkept trying to climb up the slippery glass walls of the jar and falling\\nback. \"I found it in the quad,\" he said. \"Here? By the dorm?\" \"Yeah. You know the hotel down the street? They release fireflies in their garden for summer guests. This one made it over here.\" Storm Trooper was busy stuffing clothes and notebooks into his black\\nBoston bag as he spoke. We were several weeks into the summer holidays, and he and I were\\nalmost the only ones left in the dorm. I had carried on with my jobs\\nrather than go back to Kobe, and he had stayed on for a practical\\ntraining session. Now that the training had ended, he was going back\\nto the mountains of Yamanashi. \"You could give this to your girlfriend,\" he said. Tm sure she\\'d love\\nit.\" \"Thanks,\" I said. After dark the dorm was hushed, like a ruin. The flag had been\\nlowered and the lights glowed in the windows of the dining hall. With\\nso few students left, they turned on only half the lights in the place,\\nkeeping the right half dark and the left lighted. Still, the smell of\\ndinner drifted up to me - some kind of cream stew. I took my bottled firefly to the roof. No one else was up there. A white\\nvest hung on a clothesline that someone had forgotten to take in,\\nwaving in the evening breeze like the discarded shell of some huge\\ninsect. I climbed a steel ladder in the corner of the roof to the top of\\nthe dormitory\\'s water tank. The tank was still warm with the heat of\\nthe sunlight it had absorbed during the day. I sat in the narrow space\\nabove the tank, leaning against the handrail and coming face-to-face\\nwith an almost full white moon. The lights of Shinjuku glowed to the\\nright, Ikebukuro to the left. Car headlights flowed in brilliant streams\\nfrom one pool of light to the other. A dull roar of jumbled sounds\\nhung over the city like a cloud. The firefly made a faint glow in the bottom of the jar, its light all too\\nweak, its colour all too pale. I hadn\\'t seen a firefly in years, but the\\nones in my memory sent a far more intense light into the summer\\ndarkness, and that brilliant, burning image was the one that had stayed\\nwith me all that time. Maybe this firefly was on the verge of death. I gave the jar a few\\nshakes. The firefly bumped against the glass walls and tried to fly, but\\nits light remained dim. I tried to remember when I had last seen fireflies, and where it might\\nhave been. I could see the scene in my mind, but was unable to recall\\nthe time or place. I could hear the sound of water in the darkness and\\nsee an old-fashioned brick sluice gate. It had a handle you could turn\\nto open and close the gate. The stream it controlled was small enough\\nto be hidden by the grass on its banks. The night was dark, so dark I\\ncouldn\\'t see my feet when I turned out my torch. Hundreds of fireflies\\ndrifted over the pool of water held back by the sluice gate, their hot\\nglow reflected in the water like a shower of sparks. I closed my eyes and steeped myself in that long-ago darkness. I heard\\nthe wind with unusual clarity. A light breeze swept past me, leaving\\nstrangely brilliant trails in the dark. I opened my eyes to find the\\ndarkness of the summer night a few degrees deeper than it had been. I twisted open the lid of the jar and took out the firefly, setting it on\\nthe two-inch lip of the water tank. It seemed not to grasp its new\\nsurroundings. It hobbled around the head of a steel bolt, catching its\\nlegs on curling scabs of paint. It moved to the right until it found its\\nway blocked, then circled back to the left. Finally, with some effort, it\\nmounted the head of the bolt and crouched there for a while,\\nunmoving, as if it had taken its last breath. Still leaning against the handrail, I studied the firefly. Neither I nor it\\nmade a move for a very long time. The wind continued sweeping past\\nthe two of us while the numberless leaves of the zelkova tree rustled\\nin the darkness. I waited for ever. Only much later did the firefly take to the air. As if some thought had\\nsuddenly occurred to it, the firefly spread its wings, and in a moment it had flown past the handrail to float in the pale darkness. It traced a\\nswift arc by the side of the water tank as though trying to bring back a\\nlost interval in time. And then, after hovering there for a few seconds\\nas if to watch its curved line of light blend into the wind, it finally\\nflew off to the east. Long after the firefly had disappeared, the trail of its light remained\\ninside me, its pale, faint glow hovering on and on in the thick darkness\\nbehind my eyelids like a lost soul. More than once I tried stretching my hand out in the dark. My fingers\\ntouched nothing. The faint glow remained, just beyond my grasp. During the summer holidays the university called in the riot police.\\nThey broke down the barricades and arrested the students inside. This\\nwas nothing new. It\\'s what all the students were doing at the time. The\\nuniversities were not so easily \"dismantled\". Massive amounts of\\ncapital had been invested in them, and they were not about to dissolve\\njust because a few students had gone wild. And in fact those students\\nwho had sealed off the campus had not wanted to dismantle the\\nuniversity either. All they had really wanted to do was shift the\\nbalance of power within the university structure, about which I\\ncouldn’t have cared less. And so, when the strike was finally crashed, I\\nfelt nothing. I went to the campus in September expecting to find rubble. The place\\nwas untouched. The library\\'s books had not been carted off, the tutors\\'\\noffices had not been destroyed, the student affairs office had not been\\nburned to the ground. I was thunderstruck. What the hell had they\\nbeen doing behind the barricades? When the strike was defused and lectures started up again under\\npolice occupation, the first ones to take their seats in the classrooms\\nwere those arseholes who had led the strike. As if nothing had ever\\nhappened, they sat there taking notes and answering \"present\" when\\nthe register was taken. I found this incredible. After all, the strike was\\nstill in effect. There had been no declaration bringing it to an end. All\\nthat had happened was that the university had called in the riot police\\nand torn down the barricades, but the strike itself was supposed to be continuing. The arseholes had screamed their heads off at the time of\\nthe strike, denouncing students who opposed it (or just expressed\\ndoubts about it), at times even trying them in their own kangaroo\\ncourts. I made a point of visiting those former leaders and asking why\\nthey were attending lectures instead of continuing to strike, but they\\ncouldn\\'t give me a straight answer. What could they have said? That\\nthey were afraid of losing marks through lack of attendance? To think\\nthat these idiots had been the ones screaming for the dismantling of\\nthe university! What a joke. The wind changes direction a little, and\\ntheir cries become whispers. Hey, Kizuki, I thought, you\\'re not missing a damn thing. This world is\\na piece of shit. The arseholes are getting good marks and helping to\\ncreate a society in their own disgusting image. For a while I attended lectures but refused to answer when they took\\nthe register. I knew it was a pointless gesture, but I felt so bad I had no\\nchoice. All I managed to do was isolate myself more than ever from\\nthe other students. By remaining silent when my name was called, I\\nmade everyone uncomfortable for a few seconds. None of the other\\nstudents spoke to me, and I spoke to none of them. By the second week in September I reached the conclusion that a\\nuniversity education was meaningless. I decided to think of it as a\\nperiod of training in techniques for dealing with boredom. I had\\nnothing I especially wanted to accomplish in society that would\\nrequire me to abandon my studies straight away, and so I went to my\\nlectures each day, took notes, and spent my free time in the library\\nreading or looking\\nthings up. And though that second week in September had rolled around, there\\nwas no sign of Storm Trooper. More than unusual, this was an earth-\\nshattering development. University had started up again, and it was\\ninconceivable that Storm Trooper would miss lectures. A thin layer of dust covered his desk and radio. His plastic cup and toothbrush, tea\\ntin, insecticide spray and so on stood in a neat row on his shelf. I kept the room clean in his absence. I had picked up the habit of\\nneatness over the past year and a half and without him there to take\\ncare of the room, I had no choice but to do it. I swept the floor each\\nday, wiped the window every third day, and aired my mattress once a\\nweek, waiting for him to come back and tell me what a great job I had\\ndone. But he never came back. I returned from lectures one day to find all\\nhis stuff gone and his name tag removed from the door. I went to the\\ndorm Head\\'s room and asked what had happened. \"He\\'s withdrawn from the dormitory,\" he said. \"You\\'ll be alone in the\\nroom for the time being.\" I couldn\\'t get him to tell me why Storm Trooper had disappeared. This\\nwas a man whose greatest joy in life was to control everything and\\nkeep others in the dark. Storm Trooper\\'s iceberg poster stayed on the wall for a time, but I\\neventually took it down and replaced it with Jim Morrison and Miles\\nDavis. This made the room seem a little more like my own. I used\\nsome of the money I had saved from work to buy a small stereo. At\\nnight I would drink alone and listen to music. I thought about Storm\\nTrooper every now and then, but I enjoyed living alone. At 11.30 a.m. one Monday, after a lecture on Euripides in History of\\nDrama, I took a ten-minute walk to a little restaurant and had an\\nomelette and salad for lunch. The place was on a quiet backstreet and\\nwas slightly more expensive than the student dining hall, but you\\ncould relax there, and they knew how to make a good omelette.\\n\"They\" were a married couple who rarely spoke to each other, plus\\none part-time waitress. As I sat there eating by the window, a group of\\nfour students came in, two men and two women, all rather neatly\\ndressed. They took the table near the door, spent some time looking over the menu and discussing their options, until one of them reported\\ntheir choices to the waitress. Before long I noticed that one of the girls kept glancing in my\\ndirection. She had extremely short hair and wore dark sunglasses and\\na white cotton mini-dress. I had no idea who she was, so I went on\\nwith my lunch, but she soon slipped out of her seat and came over to\\nwhere I was sitting. With one hand on the edge of my table, she said,\\n\"You\\'re Watanabe, aren\\'t you?\" I raised my head and looked at her more closely. Still I could not\\nrecall ever having seen her. She was the kind of girl you notice, so if I\\nhad met her before I should have been able to recognize her\\nimmediately, and there weren\\'t that many people in my university who\\nknew me by name. \"Mind if I sit down?\" she asked. \"Or are you expecting somebody?\" Still uncertain, I shook my head. \"No, nobody\\'s coming. Please.\" With a wooden clunk, she dragged a chair out and sat down opposite,\\nstaring straight at me through her sunglasses, then\\nglancing at my plate. \"Looks good,\" she said. \"It is good. Mushroom omelette and green pea salad.\" \"Damn,\" she\\nsaid. \"Oh, well. I\\'ll get it next time. I’ve\\nalready ordered something else.\" \"What are you having?\" \"Macaroni and cheese.\" \"Their macaroni and cheese isn\\'t bad, either,\" I said. \"By the way, do I\\nknow you? I don\\'t recall. ..\" \"Euripides,\" she said. \\n\"Electra.\\n \"No god hearkens to the voice of lost\\nElectra.\\' You know - the class just ended.\" I stared hard at her. She took off her sunglasses. At last I remembered\\nher - a first-year I had seen in History of Drama. A striking change in\\nhairstyle had prevented me recognizing her. \"Oh,\" I said, touching a point a few inches below my shoulder, \"your\\nhair was down to here before the summer holidays.\" \"You\\'re right,\" she said. \"I had a perm this summer, and it was \\njust awful.\\n I was ready\\nto kill myself. I looked like a corpse on the beach with seaweed stuck\\nto my head. So I decided as long as I was ready to die, I might as well\\ncut it all off. At least it\\'s cool in the summer.\" She ran her hand\\nthrough her pixie cut and gave me a smile. \"It looks good, though,\" I said, still munching my omelette. \"Let me see your profile.\" She turned away and held the pose a few seconds. \"Yeah, I thought so. It really looks good on you. Nicely shaped head.\\nPretty ears, too, uncovered like that.\" \"So I\\'m \\nnot\\n mad after all! I thought I looked good myself once I cut it\\nall off. Not one guy likes it, though. They all tell me I look like a\\nconcentration camp survivor. What\\'s this thing that guys have for girls\\nwith long hair? Fascists, the whole bunch of them! Why do guys all\\nthink girls with long hair are the classiest, the sweetest, the most\\nfeminine? I mean, I myself know at least 250 unclassy girls with long\\nhair. Really.\" \"I think you look better now than you did before,\" I said. And I meant\\nit. As far as I could recall, with long hair she had been just another\\ncute student. A fresh and physical life force surged from the girl who\\nsat before me now. She was like a small animal that has popped into\\nthe world with the coming of spring. Her eyes moved like an\\nindependent organism with joy, laughter, anger, amazement and\\ndespair. I hadn\\'t seen a face so vivid and expressive in ages, and I\\nenjoyed watching it live and move. \"Do you mean it?\" she asked. I nodded, still munching on my salad. She put on her sunglasses and looked at me from behind them. \"You\\'re not lying, are you?\" \"I like to think of myself as an honest man,\" I said. \"Far out.\" \"So tell me: why do you wear such dark glasses?\" \"I felt defenceless when my hair got short all of a sudden. As if somebody had thrown me into a crowd all naked.\" \"Makes\\nsense,\" I said, eating the last of my omelette. She watched me with\\nintense interest. \"You don\\'t have to go back to them?\" I asked, indicating her three\\ncompanions. \"Nah. I\\'ll go back when they serve the food. Am I interrupting your\\nmeal?\" \"There\\'s nothing left to interrupt,\" I said, ordering coffee when she\\nshowed no sign of leaving. The wife took my dishes and brought milk\\nand sugar. \"Now \\nyou\\n tell \\nme,\"\\n she said. \"Why didn’t you answer today when they\\ncalled the register? You \\nare\\n Watanabe, aren\\'t you? Tom Watanabe?\" \"That’s me.\" \"So why didn\\'t you answer?\" \"I just didn\\'t feel like it today.\" She took off her sunglasses again, set them on the table, and looked at\\nme as if she were staring into the cage of some rare animal at a zoo. \"I just didn’t feel like it today.\" You talk like Humphrey Bogart. Cool.\\nTough.\" \"Don’t be silly. I’m just an ordinary guy like everybody else.\" The wife brought my coffee and set it on the table. I took a sip without\\nadding sugar or milk. \"Look at that. You drink it black.\" \"It’s got nothing to do with Humphrey Bogart,\" I explained patiently.\\n\"I just don’t happen to have a sweet tooth. I think you\\'ve got me all\\nwrong.\" \"Why are you so tanned?\" \\'Tve been hiking around the last couple of weeks. Rucksack. Sleeping\\nbag.\" \"Where\\'d you go?\" \"Kanazawa. Noto Peninsula. Up to Niigata.\" \"Alone?\" \"Alone,\" I said. \"Found some company here and there.\" \"Some romantic company? New women in far-off places.\" \"Romantic? Now I\\nknow\\n you\\'ve got me wrong. How\\'s a guy with a sleeping bag on his\\nback and his face all stubbly supposed to have romance?\" \"Do you always travel alone like that?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"You enjoy solitude?\" she asked, resting her cheek on her hand.\\n\"Travelling alone, eating alone, sitting by yourself in lecture halls ...\"\\n\"Nobody likes being alone that much. I don\\'t go out of my way to\\nmake friends, that\\'s all. It just leads to disappointment.\" The tip of one earpiece in her mouth, sunglasses dangling down, she\\nmumbled, \"\"Nobody likes being alone. I just hate to be disappointed.\\'\\nYou can use that line if you ever write your autobiography.\" \"Thanks,\" I said. \"Do you like green?\" \"Why do you ask?\" \"You\\'re wearing a green polo shirt.\" \"Not especially. I\\'ll wear anything.\" \"\"Not especially. I\\'ll wear anything.\\' I love the way you talk. Like\\nspreading plaster, nice and smooth. Has anybody ever told you that?\"\\n\"Nobody,\" I said. \"My name\\'s Midori,\" she said. \"\"Green’. But green looks terrible on\\nme. Weird, huh? It\\'s like I\\'m cursed, don\\'t you think? My sister\\'s name\\nis Momoko: \"Peach girl\\'.\" \"Does she look good in pink?\" \"She looks \\ngreat\\n in pink! She was \\nborn\\n to wear pink. It\\'s totally\\nunfair.\" The food arrived at Midori\\'s table, and a guy in a madras jacket called\\nout to her, \"Hey, Midori, come \\'n\\' get it!\" She waved at him as if to\\nsay \"I know\". \"Tell me,\" she said. \"Do you take lecture notes? In drama?\" \"I do.\" \"I hate to ask, but could I borrow your notes? I\\'ve missed twice, and I\\ndon\\'t know anybody in the class.\" \"No problem,\" I said, pulling the\\nnotebook from my bag. After checking to make sure I hadn\\'t written anything personal in it, I\\nhanded it to Midori. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"Are you coming to lectures the day after\\ntomorrow?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Meet me here at noon. I\\'ll give you back your notebook and buy you\\nlunch. I mean ... it\\'s not as if you get an upset stomach or anything if\\nyou don\\'t eat alone, right?\" \"No,\" I said. \"But you don\\'t have to buy me lunch just because I\\'m\\nlending you my notebook.\" \"Don\\'t worry,\" she said. \"I like buying people lunch. Anyway,\\nshouldn’t you write it down somewhere? You won’t forget?\" \"I won\\'t forget. Day after tomorrow. Twelve o\\'clock. Midori. Green.\"\\nFrom the other table, somebody called out, \"Hurry up, Midori, your\\nfood\\'s getting cold!\" She ignored the call and asked me, \"Have you always talked like\\nthat?\" \"I think so,\" I said. \"Never noticed before.\" And in fact no one had\\never told me there was anything unusual about the way I spoke. She seemed to be mulling something over for a few seconds. Then she\\nstood up with a smile and went back to her table. She waved to me as\\nI walked past their table, but the three others barely glanced in my\\ndirection. At noon on Wednesday there was no sign of Midori in the restaurant. I\\nthought I might wait for her over a beer, but the place started to fill up\\nas soon as the drink arrived, so I ordered lunch and ate alone. I\\nfinished at 12.35, but still no Midori. Paying my bill, I went outside\\nand crossed the street to a little shrine, where I waited on the stone\\nsteps for my head to clear and Midori to come. I gave up at one\\no\\'clock and went to read in the library. At two I went to my German lecture. When it was over I went to the student affairs office and looked for\\nMidori\\'s name in the class list for History of Drama. The only Midori\\nin the class was Midori Kobayashi. Next I flipped through the cards of\\nthe student files and found the address and phone number of a Midori\\nKobayashi who had entered the university in 1969. She lived in a\\nnorth-west suburb, Toshima, with her family. I slipped into a phone\\nbox and dialled the number. A man answered: \"Kobayashi Bookshop.\" Kobayashi Bookshop? \"Sorry to bother you,\" I said, \"but I wonder if Midori might be in?\" \"No, she\\'s not,\" he said. \"Do you think she might be on campus?\" \"Hmm, no, she\\'s probably at the hospital. Who\\'s calling, please?\"\\nInstead of answering, I thanked him and hung up. The hospital? Could\\nshe have been injured or fallen ill? But the man had spoken without\\nthe least sense of emergency. \"She\\'s probably at the hospital,\" he had\\nsaid, as easily as he might have said \"She\\'s at the fish shop\". I thought\\nabout a few other possibilities until thinking itself became too\\nproblematic, then I went back to the donn and stretched out on my bed\\nreading \\nLord Jim,\\n which I’d borrowed from Nagasawa. When I had\\nfinished it, I went to his room to give it back. Nagasawa was on his way to the dining hall, so I went with him for\\ndinner. \"How’d the exams go?\" I asked. The second round of upper level\\nexams for the Foreign Ministry had been held in August.\\n\"Same as always,\" said Nagasawa as if it had been nothing. \"You take \\'em, you pass. Group discussions, interviews ... like\\nscrewin\\' a chick.\" \"In other words, easy,\" I said. \"When do they let you know?\" \"First week of October. If I pass. I\\'ll buy you a big dinner.\" \"So tell me, what kind of guys make it to round two? All superstars like you?\" \"Don\\'t be stupid. They\\'re a bunch of idiots. Idiots or weirdos. I\\'d say\\n95 per cent of the guys who want to be bureaucrats aren\\'t worth shit.\\nI\\'m not kidding. They can barely read.\" \"So why are you trying to join the Foreign Ministry?\" \"All kinds of reasons,\" said Nagasawa. \"I like the idea of working\\noverseas, for one. But mainly I want to test my abilities. If I\\'m going\\nto test myself, I want to do it in the biggest field there is - the nation. I\\nwant to see how high I can climb, how much power I can exercise in\\nthis insanely huge bureaucratic system. Know what I mean?\" \"Sounds like a game.\" \"It is a game. I don’t give a damn about power and money per se.\\nReally, I don\\'t. I may be a selfish bastard, but I\\'m incredibly cool\\nabout shit like that. I could be a Zen saint. The one thing I do have,\\nthough, is curiosity. I want to see what I can do out there in the big,\\ntough world.\" \"And you have no use for \"ideals\\', I suppose?\" \"None. Life doesn\\'t require ideals. It requires standards of action.\" \"But there are lots of other ways to live, aren\\'t there?\" I asked. \"You like the way I live, don\\'t you?\" \"That\\'s beside the point,\" I said. \"I could never get into Tokyo\\nUniversity; I can\\'t sleep with any girl I want whenever I want to; I\\'m\\nno great talker; people don\\'t look up to me; I haven\\'t got a girlfriend;\\nand the future\\'s not going to open up to me when I get a literature BA\\nfrom a second-rate private university. What does it matter if I like the\\nway you live?\" \"Are you saying you \\nenvy\\n the way I live?\" \"No, I don\\'t,\" I said. \"I\\'m too used to being who I am. And I don’t\\nreally give a damn about Tokyo University or the Foreign Ministry.\\nThe one thing I envy you for is having a terrific girlfriend like\\nHatsumi.\" Nagasawa shut up and ate. When dinner was over he said, \"You know. Watanabe, I have this feeling like, maybe 10 years or 20 years after\\nwe get out of this place, we\\'re going to meet again somewhere. And\\none way or another, I think we\\'re going to have some connection.\"\\n\"Sounds like Dickens,\" I said with a smile. \"I guess it does,\" he said, smiling back. \"But my hunches are usually\\nright.\" The two of us left the dining hall and went out to a bar. We stayed\\nthere drinking until after nine. \"Tell me, Nagasawa,\" I asked, \"what is the \"standard of action\\' in \\nyour\\nlife?\" \"You\\'ll laugh if I tell you,\" he said. \"No I won\\'t.\" \"All right,\" he said. \"To be a gentleman.\" I didn’t laugh, but I nearly fell off my chair. \"To be a gentleman? A\\ngentleman?\" \"You heard me.\" \"What does it mean to be a gentleman? How do you define it?\" \"A gentleman is someone who does not what he \\nwants\\n to do but what\\nhe \\nshould\\n do.\" \"You\\'re the weirdest guy I\\'ve ever met,\" I said. \"You\\'re the straightest guy I\\'ve ever met,\" he said. And he paid for us\\nboth. I went to the following week\\'s drama lecture, but still saw no sign of\\nMidori Kobayashi. After a quick survey of the room convinced me she\\nwasn\\'t there, I took my usual seat in the front row and wrote a letter to\\nNaoko while I waited for the lecturer to arrive. I wrote about my\\nsummer travels - the roads I had walked, the towns I had passed\\nthrough, the people I had met. \\nAnd every night I thought of you. Now that I can no\\nlonger see you, I realize how much I need you. University is incredibly\\nboring, but as a matter of self-discipline I am going to all my lectures and doing all the assignments. Everything seems pointless since you\\nleft. I\\'d like to have a nice, long talk with you. If possible. I\\'d like to\\nvisit your sanatorium and see you for several hours. And, if possible.\\nI\\'d like to go out walking with you side by side the way we used to.\\nPlease try to answer this letter - even a short note. I won\\'t mind. I filled four sheets, folded them, slipped them into an envelope, and\\naddressed it to Naoko care of her family. By then the lecturer had arrived, wiping the sweat from his brow as he\\ntook the register. He was a small, moumfullooking man who walked\\nwith a metal cane. While not exactly fun, the lectures in his course\\nwere always well prepared and worthwhile. After remarking that the\\nweather was as hot as ever, he began to talk about the use of the \\ndeus\\nex machina\\n in Euripides and explained how the concept of \"god\" was\\ndifferent in Euripides than in Aeschylus or Sophocles. He had been\\ntalking for some 15 minutes when the lecture-hall door opened and in\\nwalked Midori. She was wearing a dark blue sports shirt, cream-\\ncoloured cotton trousers and her usual sunglasses. After flashing a\\n\"sorry I\\'m late\" kind of smile at the professor, she sat down next to\\nme. Then she took a notebook - my notebook - from her shoulder bag,\\nand handed it to me. Inside, I found a note: \\nSorry about Wednesday.\\nAre you angry? The lecture was about half over and the professor was drawing a\\nsketch of a Greek stage on the blackboard when the door opened again\\nand two students in helmets walked in. They looked like some kind of\\ncomedy team, one tall, thin and pale, the other short, round and dark\\nwith a long beard that didn’t suit him. The tall one carried an armful of\\npolitical agitation handbills. The short one walked up to the professor\\nand said, with a degree of politeness, that they would like to use the\\nsecond half of his lecture for political debate and hoped that he would\\ncooperate, adding, \"The world is full of problems far more urgent and\\nrelevant than Greek tragedy.\" This was more an announcement than a\\nrequest. The professor replied, \"I rather doubt that the world has problems far more urgent and relevant than Greek tragedy, but you\\'re\\nnot going to listen to anything I have to say, so do what you like.\"\\nGrasping the edge of the table, he set his feet on the floor, picked up\\nhis cane and limped out of the classroom. While the tall student passed out his handbills, the round one went to\\nthe podium and started lecturing. The handbills were full of the usual\\nsimplistic sloganeering: \"SMASH FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS FOR UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT!\",\\n\"MARSHAL ALL FORCES FOR NEW ALL-CAMPUS STRIKE!\",\\n\"CRUSH THE IMPERIAL-EDUCATIONAL-INDUSTRIAL\\nCOMPLEX!\" I had no problem with what they were saying, but the writing was\\nlame. It had nothing to inspire confidence or arouse the passions. And\\nthe round man\\'s speech was just as bad - the same old tune with\\ndifferent words. The true enemy of this bunch was not State Power but\\nLack of Imagination. \"Let\\'s get out of here,\" said Midori. I nodded and stood, and the two of us made for the door. The round\\nman said something to me at that point, but I couldn\\'t catch it. Midori\\nwaved to him and said. \"See ya later.\" ,Hey,\\n are we counter-revolutionaries?\" Midori asked me when we\\nwere outside. \"Are we going to be strung upon telephone poles if the\\nrevolution succeeds?\" \"Let\\'s have lunch first, just in case.\" \"Good. There\\'s a place I want to take you to. It\\'s a bit far, though. Can\\nyou spare the time?\" \"Yeah, I\\'m free until my two o\\'clock class.\" Midori took me by bus to Yotsuya and showed me to a fancy boxed-\\nlunch speciality shop in a sheltered spot just behind the station. The\\nminute we sat down they served us soup and the lunch of the day in\\nsquare, red-lacquered boxes. This was a place worth a bus ride to eat\\nat. \"Great food,\" I said. \"And cheap, too. I\\'ve been coming here since school. My old school\\'s\\njust down the street. They were so strict, we had to sneak out to eat\\nhere. They\\'d suspend you if they caught you eating out.\" Without the sunglasses, Midori\\'s eyes looked somewhat sleepier than\\nthey had the last time. When she was not playing with the narrow\\nsilver bracelet on her left wrist, she would be nibbing at the corners of\\nher eyes with the tip of her little finger. \"Tired?\" I asked. \"Kind of. I\\'m not getting enough sleep. But I\\'m OK, don’t worry,\" she\\nsaid. \"Sony about the other day. Something important came up and I\\njust couldn’t get out of it. All of a sudden, in the morning. I thought\\nabout calling you at the restaurant, but I couldn’t remember the name,\\nand I didn\\'t know your home number. Did you wait long?\" \"No big deal. I\\'ve got a lot of time on my hands.\" A lot?\" \"Way more than I need. I wish I could give you some to help \\n5011\\nsleep.\" Midori rested her cheek on her hand and smiled at me. \"What a nice\\nguy you are.\" \"Not nice. I just have time to kill,\" I said. \"By the way, I called your\\nhouse that day and somebody told me you were at the hospital.\\nSomething wrong?\" \"You called my house?\" she asked with a slight wrinkle forming\\nbetween her eyebrows. \"How did you get my number?\" \"Looked it up in the student affairs office. Anyone can do that.\" She nodded once or twice and started playing with the bracelet again.\\n\"I never would have thought of that. I suppose I could have looked up\\nyour number. Anyway, about the hospital. I\\'ll tell you next time. I\\ndon’t feel like it now. Sorry.\" \"That\\'s OK. I didn\\'t mean to pry.\" \"No, you\\'re not prying. I\\'m just kind of tired. Like a monkey in the rain.\" \"Shouldn’t you go home and get some sleep?\" \"Not now. Let\\'s get out\\nof here.\" She took me to her old school, a short walk from Yotsuya. Passing the station, I thought about Naoko and our endless walking. It\\nhad all started from there. I realized that if I hadn\\'t run into Naoko on\\nthe train that Sunday in May, My life would have been very different\\nfrom what it was now. But then I changed my mind: no, even if we\\nhadn\\'t met that day, my life might not have been any different. We\\nwere supposed to meet. If not then, some other time. I didn’t have any\\nbasis for thinking this: it was just a feeling. Midori Kobayashi and I sat on a park bench together, looking at her\\nold school. Ivy clung to the walls, and pigeons huddled under the\\ngables, resting their wings. It was a nice, old building with character.\\nA great oak tree stood in the playground, and a column of white\\nsmoke rose straight up beside it. The fading summer light gave the\\nsmoke a soft and cloudy look. \"Do you know what that smoke is?\" Midori asked me all of a sudden.\\n\"No idea,\" I said. \"They\\'re burning sanitary towels.\" \"Really?\" I couldn’t think of anything else to say. \"Sanitary towels, tampons, stuff like that,\" she said with a smile. \"It is\\na girls\\' school. The old caretaker collects them from all the receptacles\\nand burns them in the incinerator. \\nThat\\'s\\n the smoke.\" \"Whoa.\" \"Yeah, that\\'s what I used to say to myself whenever I was in class and\\nsaw the smoke outside the window. \"Whoa\\'. Think about it: the school\\nhad almost a thousand girls. So, say 900 of them have started their\\nperiods, and maybe a fifth of them are menstruating at any one time:\\n180 girls. That\\'s 180 girls\\' worth of towels in the receptacles every\\nday.\" \"I bet you\\'re right - though I\\'m not sure about the maths.\" \"Anyway, it\\'s a lot. 180 girls. What do you think it feels like to collect\\nand bum that much stuff?\" \"Can\\'t imagine,\" I said. How could I have imagined what the old man\\nwas going through? Midori and I went on watching the smoke. \"I really didn\\'t want to go to this school,\" Midori said. She gave her\\nhead a little shake. \"I wanted to go to an absolutely ordinary State\\nschool with ordinary people where I could relax and have fun like an\\nordinary teenager. But my parents thought it would look good for me\\nto go to this fancy place. They\\'re the ones who stuck me in here. You\\nknow: that\\'s what happens when you do well in primary school. The\\nteacher tells your parents \"With marks like hers, she ought to go\\nthere.\\' So\\n that\\'s where I ended up. I went for six years and I never\\nliked it. All I could think about was getting out. And you know. I\\'ve\\ngot certificates of merit for never having been late or missed a day of\\nschool. That\\'s how much I hated the place. Get it?\" \"No, I don\\'t get it.\" \"It\\'s because I hated the place so much. I wasn\\'t going to let it beat me.\\nIf I’d let it get to me once I’d be finished. I was scared I\\'d just keep\\nslipping down and down. I\\'d crawl to school with a temperature of\\n103. The teacher would ask me if I was sick, but I’d say no. When I\\nleft they gave me certificates for perfect attendance and punctuality,\\nplus a French dictionary. That\\'s why I\\'m taking German now. I didn’t\\nwant to owe this school \\nanything.\\n I\\'m not kidding.\" \"Why did you hate it so much? \"Did you like \\nyour\\n school?\" \"Well, no, but I didn’t especially hate it, either. I went to an ordinary\\nState school but I never thought about it one way or another.\" \"Well, \\nthis\\n school,\" Midori said, scratching the comer of her eye with\\nher little finger, \"had nothing but upper-class girls - almost a thousand\\ngirls with good backgrounds and good exam results. \\nRich\\n girls. They\\nhad to be rich to survive. High tuition, endless contributions. expensive school trips. For instance, if we went to Kyoto, they’d put\\nus up in a first-class inn and serve us tea ceremony food on lacquer\\ntables, and they\\'d take us once a year to the most expensive hotel in\\nTokyo to study table manners. I mean, this was no ordinary \\nschool.\\nOut of 160 girls in my class, I was the only one from a middle-class\\nneighbourhood like Toshima. I looked at the \\nschool\\n register once to\\nsee where the others lived, and every single one of them was from a\\nrich area. Well, no, there was \\none\\n girl from way out in Chiba with the\\nfarmers, so I got kind of friendly with her. And she was really nice.\\nShe invited rre to her house, though she apologized for how far I\\'d\\nhave to travel to get there. I went and it was \\nincredible,\\n this giant\\npiece of land you’d have to walk 15 minutes to get around. It had this\\namazing garden and two dogs like compact cars they fed \\nsteaks\\n to.\\nBut still, this girl felt embarrassed about living out in Chiba. This is a\\ngirl who would be driven to school in a Mercedes Benz if she was\\nlate! By a chauffeur! Like right out of the \\nGreen Hornet:\\n the hat, the\\nwhite gloves, the whole deal. And still she had this inferiority\\ncomplex. Can you believe it?\" I shook my head. \"I was the only one in the whole school who lived in a place like Kita-\\nOtsuka Toshima. And under \"parent\\'s profession\\' it said \"bookshop\\nowner\\'. Everybody in my class thought that was so neat: \"Oh, you\\'re\\nso lucky, you can read any book you like\\' and stuff. Of course, they\\nwere thinking of some monster bookshop like Kinokuniya. They could\\nnever have imagined the poor, little Kobayashi Bookshop. The door\\ncreaks open and you see nothing but magazines. The steady sellers are\\nthe women\\'s glossies with illustrated pull-out sections on the latest\\nsexual techniques. The local housewives buy them and sit at the\\nkitchen table reading them from cover to cover, and give \\'em a try\\nwhen their husbands get home. And they\\'ve got the most incredible\\npositions! Is this what housewives have on their minds all day? The\\ncomics are the other big-seller: \\nMagazine, Sunday, Jump.\\n And of course the weeklies. So this \"bookshop\\' is almost all magazines. Oh,\\nthere are a few books, paperbacks, mysteries and swashbucklers and\\nromances. That\\'s all that sells. And How-To books: how to win at Go,\\nhow to raise bonsai, how to give wedding speeches, how to have sex,\\nhow to stop smoking, you name it. We even sell writing supplies -\\nstacks of ballpoint pens and pencils and notebooks next to the till. But\\nthat\\'s it. No \\nWar and Peace,\\n no Kenzaburo Oe, no \\nCatcher in the Rye.\\nThat\\'s the Kobayashi Bookshop. That\\'s how \"lucky\\' I am. Do you\\nthink I\\'m lucky?\" \"I can just see the place.\" \"You know what I mean. Everybody in the neighbourhood comes\\nthere, some of them for years, and we deliver. It\\'s a good business,\\nmore than enough to support a family of four; no debts, two daughters\\nin college, but that\\'s it. Nothing to spare for extras. They should never\\nhave sent me to a school like that. It was a recipe for heartache. I had\\nto listen to them grumble to me every time the school asked for a\\ncontribution, and I was always scared to death I\\'d run out of money if\\nI went out with my school friends and they wanted to eat somewhere\\nexpensive. It\\'s a miserable way to live. Is your family rich?\" \"My family? No, my parents are absolutely ordinary working people,\\nnot rich, not poor. I know it\\'s not easy for them to send me to a private\\nuniversity in Tokyo, but there\\'s just me, so it\\'s not that big a deal.\\nThey don\\'t give me much to live on, so I work part-time. We live in a\\ntypical house with a little garden and our car is a Toyota Corolla.\"\\n\"What\\'s your job like?\" \"I work in a Shinjuku record shop three nights a week. It\\'s easy. I just\\nsit there and mind the shop.\" \"You\\'re joking?\" said Midori. \"I don’t know, just looking at you I sort\\nof assumed you’d never been hard up.\" \"It\\'s true. I \\nhave\\n never been hard up. Not that I have tons of money,\\neither. I\\'m like most people.\" \"Well, \"most people\\' in my school were \\nrich,\"\\n said Midori, palms resting on her lap. \"That was the problem.\" \"So now you\\'ll have plenty of chances to see a world without that\\nproblem. More than you want to, maybe.\" \"Hey, tell me, what do you think the best thing is about being rich?\" \"I don\\'t know.\" \"Being able to say you don\\'t have any money. Like, if I suggested to a\\nschool friend we do something, she could say, \\'Sorry, I don\\'t have any\\nmoney\\'. Which is something I could \\nnever\\n say if the situation was\\nreversed. If \\nI\\n said \"I don’t have any money\\', it would \\nreally mean \"I\\ndon\\'t have any money\\'. It\\'s sad. Like, if a pretty girl says \"I look\\nterrible today, I don’t want to go out,\\' that\\'s OK, but if an ugly girl says\\nthe same thing people laugh at her. That\\'s what the world was like for\\nme. For six years, until last year.\" \"You’ll get over it.\" \"I hope so. University is such a relief! It\\'s full of ordinary people.\" She smiled with the slightest curl of her lip and smoothed her short\\nhair with the palm of her hand. \"Do you have a job?\" I asked. \"Yeah, I write map notes. You know those little pamphlets that come\\nwith maps? With descriptions of the different neighbourhoods and\\npopulation figures and points of interest. Here there\\'s so-and-so hiking\\ntrail or such-and-such a legend, or some special flower or bird. I write\\nthe texts for those things. It\\'s so easy! Takes no time at all. I can write\\na whole booklet with a day of looking things up in the library. All you\\nhave to do is master a couple of secrets and all kinds of work comes\\nyour way.\" \"What kind of secrets?\" \"Like you put in some little something that nobody else has written\\nand the people at the map company think you\\'re a literary genius and\\nsend you more work. It doesn\\'t have to be anything at all, just some\\ntiny thing. Like, say, when they built a dam in this particular valley,\\nthe water covered over a village, but still every spring the birds come up from the south and you can see them flying over the lake. Put in\\none little episode like that and people love it, it\\'s so graphic and\\nsentimental. The usual part-timer doesn\\'t bother with stuff like that,\\nbut I can make decent money with what I write.\" \"Yeah, but you have to find those \"episodes\\'.\" \"True,\" said Midori with a tilt of her head. \"But if you\\'re looking for\\nthem, you usually find them. And if you don\\'t, you can always make\\nup something harmless.\" \"Aha!\" \"Peace,\" said Midori. She said she wanted to hear about my dormitory, so I told her the\\nusual stories about the raising of the flag and Storm Trooper\\'s radio\\ncallisthenics. Storm Trooper especially made Midori laugh, as he\\nseemed to do with everyone. She said she thought it would be fun to\\nhave a look at the dorm. There was nothing fun about the place, I told\\nher: \"Just a few hundred guys in grubby rooms, drinking and\\nwanking.\" \"Does that include you?\" \"It includes every man on the face of the earth,\" I explained. \"Girls have periods and boys wank. Everybody.\" \"Even ones with girlfriends? I mean, sex partners.\" \"It\\'s got nothing to do with that. The Keio student living next door to\\nme has a wank before every date. He says it relaxes him.\" \"I don\\'t know much about that stuff. I was in a girls\\' school so long.\" \"I guess the glossy women\\'s magazines don\\'t go into that.\" \"Not at all!\" she said, laughing. \"Anyway, Watanabe, would you have\\nsome time this Sunday? Are you free?\" \"I\\'m free every Sunday. Until six, at least. That\\'s when I go to work.\"\\n\"Why don\\'t you visit me? At the Kobayashi Bookshop. The shop itself\\nwill be closed, but I have to hang around there alone all day. I might\\nbe getting an important phone call. How about lunch? I\\'ll cook for you.\" \"I\\'d like that,\" I said. Midori tore a page from a notebook and drew a detailed map of the\\nway to her place. She used a red pen to make a large X where the\\nhouse stood. \"You can\\'t miss it. There\\'s a big sign: \\'Kobayashi Bookshop\\'. Come at\\nnoon. I\\'ll have lunch ready.\" I thanked her and put the map in my pocket. \"I’d better get back to\\ncampus now,\" I said. \"My German lecture starts at two.\" Midori said\\nshe had somewhere to go and took the train from Yotsuya. Sunday morning I got up at nine, shaved, did my laundry and hung out\\nthe clothes on the roof. It was a beautiful day. The first smell of\\nautumn was in the air. Red dragonflies flitted around the quadrangle,\\nchased by neighbourhood kids swinging nets. With no wind, the\\nRising Sun flag hung limp on its pole. I put on a freshly ironed shirt\\nand walked from the dorm to the tram stop. A student neighbourhood\\non a Sunday morning: the streets were dead, virtually empty, most\\nshops closed. What few sounds there were echoed with special clarity.\\nA girl wearing sabots clip-clopped across the asphalt roadway, and\\nnext to the tram shelter four or five kids were throwing rocks at a row\\nof empty cans. A florist\\'s was open, so I went in and bought some\\ndaffodils. Daffodils in autumn: that was strange. But I had always\\nliked that particular flower. Three old women were the only passengers on the Sunday morning\\ntram. They all looked at me and my flowers. One of them gave me a\\nsmile. I smiled back. I sat in the last seat and watched the ancient\\nhouses passing close to the window. The tram almost touched the\\noverhanging eaves. The laundry deck of one house had ten potted\\ntomato plants, next to which a big black cat lay stretched out in the\\nsun. In the garden of another house, a little girl was blowing soap\\nbubbles. I heard an Ayumi Ishida song coming from somewhere, and could even catch the smell of curry cooking. The tram snaked its way\\nthrough this private back-alley world. A few more passengers got on\\nat stops along the way, but the three old women went on talking\\nintently about something, huddled together face-to-face. I got off near Otsuka Station and followed Midori\\'s map down a broad\\nstreet without much to look at. None of the shops along the way\\nseemed to be doing very well, housed as they were in old buildings\\nwith gloomy-looking interiors and faded writing on some of the signs.\\nJudging from the age and style of the buildings, this area had been\\nspared the wartime air raids, leaving whole blocks intact. A few of the\\nplaces had been entirely rebuilt, but just about all had been enlarged or\\nrepaired in places, and it was these additions that tended to look\\nshabbier than the old buildings themselves. The whole atmosphere of the place suggested that most of the original\\nresidents had become fed up with the cars, the filthy air, the noise and\\nhigh rents and moved to the suburbs, leaving only cheap flats and\\ncompany apartments and hard-to-sell shops and a few stubborn people who clung to old\\nfamily properties. Everything looked blurred and grimy as though\\nwrapped in a haze of exhaust fumes. Ten minutes\\' walk down this street brought me to a corner petrol\\nstation, where I turned right into a small block of shops, in the middle\\nof which hung the sign for the Kobayashi Bookshop. True, it was not\\na big shop, but neither was it as small as Midori\\'s description had led\\nme to believe. It was just a typical neighbourhood bookshop, the same\\nkind I used to run to on the very day the boys\\' comics came out. A\\nnostalgic mood overtook me as I stood in front of the place. The whole front of the shop was sealed off by a big, rolldown metal\\nshutter inscribed with a magazine advertisement: \"WEEKLY BUNSHUN\\n SOLD HERE THURSDAYS\". I still had 15\\nminutes before noon, but I didn\\'t want to kill time wandering through\\nthe block with a handful of daffodils, so I pressed the doorbell beside the shutter and stepped a few paces back to wait. Fifteen seconds went\\nby without an answer, and I was debating with myself whether to ring\\nagain when I heard a window clatter open above me. I looked up to\\nsee Midori leaning out and waving. \"Come in,\" she yelled. \"Lift the shutter.\" \"Is it OK? I\\'m kind of early,\" I shouted back. \"No problem. Come upstairs. I\\'m busy in the kitchen.\" She pulled the\\nwindow closed. The shutter made a terrific grinding noise as I raised it three feet from\\nthe ground, ducked under, and lowered it again. The shop was pitch\\nblack inside. I managed to feel my way to the back stairway, tripping\\nover bound piles of magazines. I unlaced my shoes and climbed the\\nstairs to the living area. The interior of the house was dark and\\ngloomy. The stairs led to a simple parlour with a sofa and easy chairs.\\nIt was a small room with dim light coming in the window, reminiscent\\nof old Polish films. There was a kind of storage area on the left and\\nwhat looked like the door to a bathroom. I had to climb the steep\\nstairway with care to reach the second floor, but once I got there, it\\nwas so much brighter than the first that I felt greatly relieved. \"Over here,\" called Midori\\'s voice. To the right at the top of the stairs\\nwas what looked like a dining room, and beyond that a kitchen. The\\nhouse itself was old. but the kitchen seemed to have been refitted\\nrecently with new cabinets and a bright, shiny sink and taps. Midori\\nwas preparing food. A pot was bubbling, and the air was filled with\\nthe smell of grilled fish. \"There\\'s beer in the fridge,\" she said with a glance in my direction.\\n\"Have a seat while I finish this.\" I took a can and sat at the kitchen\\ntable. The beer was so cold it might have been in the fridge for the\\nbest part of a year. On the table lay a small, white ashtray, a\\nnewspaper, and a soy sauce dispenser. There was also a notepad and\\npen, with a phone number and some figures on the pad that seemed to\\nbe calculations connected with shopping. \"I should have this done in ten minutes,\" she said. \"Can you stand the\\nwait?\" \"Of course I can,\" I said. \"Get good and hungry, then. I\\'m making a lot.\" I sipped my beer and focused on Midori as she went on cooking, her\\nback to me. She worked with quick, nimble movements, handling no\\nfewer than four cooking procedures at once. Over here she tasted a\\nboiled dish, and the next second she was at the cutting board, rat-tat-\\ntatting, then she took something out of the fridge and piled it in a\\nbowl, and before I knew it she had washed a pot she had finished\\nusing. From the back she looked like an Indian percussionist - ringing\\na bell, tapping a block, striking a water-buffalo bone, each movement\\nprecise and economical, with perfect balance. I watched in awe. \"Let me know if there\\'s something I can do,\" I said, just in case. \"That\\'s OK,\" said Midori with a smile in my direction. \"I\\'m used to\\ndoing everything alone.\" She wore slim blue jeans and a navy T-shirt.\\nAn Apple Records logo nearly covered the back of the shirt. She had\\nextremely narrow hips, as if she had somehow skipped puberty when\\nthe hips grow fuller, and this gave her a far more androgynous look\\nthan most girls have in slim jeans. The light pouring in from the\\nkitchen window gave her figure a kind of vague outline. \"You really didn’t have to put together such a feast,\" I said. \"It\\'s no feast,\" answered Midori without turning my way. \"I was too\\nbusy to do any real shopping yesterday. I\\'m just throwing together a\\nfew things I had in the fridge. Really, don\\'t worry. Besides, it\\'s\\nKobayashi family tradition to treat guests well. I don\\'t know what it is,\\nbut we like to entertain. It\\'s inborn; a kind of sickness. Not that we\\'re\\nespecially nice or people love us or anything, but if somebody shows\\nup we have to treat them well no matter what. We\\'ve all got the same\\npersonality flaw, for better or worse. Take my father, for example. He\\nhardly drinks, but the house is full of alcohol. What for? To serve\\nguests! So don\\'t hold back: drink all the beer you want.\" \"Thanks,\" I said. It suddenly dawned on me that I had left the daffodils downstairs. I\\nhad set them aside while unlacing my shoes. I slipped back downstairs\\nand found the ten bright blossoms lying in the gloom. Midori took a\\ntall, slim glass from the cupboard and arranged the flowers in it. \"I love daffodils,\" said Midori. \"I once sang \"Seven Daffodils\\' in the\\nschool talent contest. Do you know it?\" \"Of course.\" \"We had a folk group. I played guitar.\" She sang \"Seven Daffodils\\' as she arranged the food on plates. Midori\\'s cooking was far better than I had expected: an amazing\\nassortment of fried, pickled, boiled and roasted dishes using eggs,\\nmackerel, fresh greens, aubergine, mushrooms, radishes, and sesame\\nseeds, all cooked in the delicate Kyoto style. \"This is \\ngreat,\"\\n I said with my mouth full. \"OK. tell me the truth now,\" Midori said. \"You weren\\'t expecting my\\ncooking to be very good, were you - judging from the way I look?\" \"Not really,\" I said honestly. \"You\\'re from the Kansai region, so you like this kind of delicate\\nflavouring, right?\" \"Don\\'t tell me you changed style especially for me?\" \"Don\\'t be ridiculous! I wouldn\\'t go to that much trouble. No, we\\nalways eat like this.\" \"So your mother - or your father - is from Kansai?\" \"Nope. My father was bom in Tokyo and my mother\\'s from\\nFukushima. There\\'s not a single Kansai person among my relatives.\\nWe\\'re all from Tokyo or northern Kanto.\" \"I don’t get it,\" I said. \"How can you make this 100 per cent authentic\\nKansai-style food? Did somebody teach you?\" \"Well, it\\'s kind of a long story,\" she said, eating a slice of fried egg.\\n\"My mother hated housework of any kind, and she almost never cooked anything. And we bad the business to think about, so it was\\nalways \"Today we\\'re so busy, let\\'s get a take-away\\' or \"Let\\'s just buy\\nsome croquettes at the butcher\\'s\\' and so on. I hated that even when I\\nwas little, I mean like cooking a big pot of curry and eating the same\\nthing three \\ndays\\n in a row. So then one day - I was in the fifth year of\\nschool -1 decided I was going to cook for the family and do it right. I\\nwent to the big Kinokuniya in Shinjuku and bought the biggest,\\nhandsomest cookbook I could find, and I mastered it from cover to\\ncover: how to choose a cutting board, how to sharpen knives, how to\\nbone a fish, how to shave fresh bonito flakes, everything. It turned out\\nthe author of the book was from the Kansai, so all my cooking is\\nKansai style.\" \"You mean you learned how to make all this stuff from a book?!\" \"I saved my money and went to eat the real thing. That\\'s how I learned\\nflavourings. I\\'ve got pretty good intuition. I\\'m hopeless as a logical\\nthinker, though.\" \"It\\'s amazing you could teach yourself to cook so well without having\\nanyone to show you.\" \"It wasn\\'t easy,\" said Midori with a sigh, \"growing up in a house\\nwhere nobody gave a damn about food. I\\'d tell them I wanted to buy\\ndecent knives and pots and they wouldn\\'t give me the money. \"What\\nwe have now is good enough,’ they’d say, but I\\'d tell them that was\\ncrazy, you couldn’t bone a fish with the kind of flimsy knives we had\\nat home, so they\\'d say, \"What the hell do you have to bone a fish for?\\'\\nIt was hopeless trying to communicate with them. I saved up my\\nallowance and bought real professional knives and pots and strainers\\nand stuff. Can you believe it? Here\\'s a 15-year-old girl pinching\\npennies to buy strainers and whetstones and tempura pots when all the\\nother girls at school are getting huge allowances and buying beautiful\\ndresses and shoes. Don\\'t you feel sorry\\nfor me?\" I nodded, swallowing a mouthful of clear soup with fresh junsai\\ngreens. \"When I was in the sixth-form, I \\nhad\\n to have an egg fryer - a long,\\nnarrow pan for making this dashimaki-style fried egg we\\'re eating. I\\nbought it with money I was supposed to use for a new bra. For \\nthree\\nmonths I\\n had to live with \\none bra.\\n Can you believe it? I\\'d wash my bra\\nat night, go crazy trying to dry it, and wear it the next day. And if it\\ndidn\\'t dry right, I had a tragedy to deal with. The saddest thing in the\\nworld is wearing a damp bra. I\\'d walk around with tears pouring from\\nmy eyes. To think I was suffering this for an egg fryer!\" \"I see what you mean,\" I said with a laugh. \"I know I shouldn’t say this, but actually it was kind of a relief to me\\nwhen my mother died. I could run the family budget \\nmy\\n way. I could\\nbuy what I liked. So now I’ve got a relatively complete set of cooking\\nutensils. My father doesn\\'t know a thing about the budget.\" \"When did your mother die?\" \"Two years ago. Cancer. Brain tumour. She was in the hospital a year\\nand a half. It was terrible. She suffered from beginning to end. Finally\\nlost her mind; had to be doped up all the time, and still she couldn’t\\ndie, though when she did it was practically a mercy killing. It\\'s the\\nworst kind of death - the person\\'s in agony, the family goes through\\nhell. It took every yen we had. I mean, they\\'d give her these shots -\\nbang, bang, x\"20,000 a pop, and she had to have round-the-clock care.\\nI was so busy with her, I couldn’t study, had to delay university for a\\nyear. And as if that weren\\'t bad enough - \" She stopped in midsentence, put her chopsticks down and sighed. \"How did this\\nconversation turn so dark all of a sudden?\" \"It started with the business about the bras,\" I said. \"So anyway, eat your eggs and think about what I just told you,”\\nMidori said with a solemn expression. Eating my portion filled me up, but Midori ate far less. \"Cooking ruins\\nmy appetite,\" she said. She cleared the table, wiped up the crumbs. brought out a box of Marlboro, put one in her mouth and lit up with a\\nmatch. Taking hold of the glass with the daffodils, she studied the\\nblooms for a while. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll put them in a vase,\" she said. \"If I leave them like\\nthis, it\\'s like I just happened to pick them by a pond somewhere and\\nthrew them into the first thing that came to hand.\" \"I did pick them by the pond at Otsuka Station,\" I said. She chuckled. \"You \\nare\\n a weird one. Making jokes with a perfectly\\nstraight face.\" Chin in hand, she smoked half her cigarette, then crushed it out in the\\nashtray. She nibbed her eyes as if smoke had got into them. \"Girls are supposed to be a little more elegant when they put out their\\ncigarettes. You did that like a lumberjack. You shouldn\\'t just cram it\\ndown in the ashtray but press it lightly around the edges of the ash.\\nThen it doesn\\'t get all bent up. And girls are \\nnever\\n supposed to blow\\nsmoke through their noses. And most girls wouldn’t talk about how\\nthey wore the same bra for three months when they\\'re eating alone\\nwith a man.\" \"I am\\n a lumberjack,\" Midori said, scratching next to her nose. \"I can\\nnever manage to be chic. I try it as a joke sometimes, but it never\\nsticks. Any more critiques for me?\" \"Girls don’t smoke Marlboro,\" I said. \"What’s the difference? One tastes as bad as another.\" She turned the\\nred Marlboro packet over and over in her hand. \"I started smoking last\\nmonth. It’s not as if I was dying for tobacco or anything. I just sort of\\nfelt like it.\" \"Why\\'s that?\" I asked. She pressed her hands together on the table and thought about it for a\\nwhile. \"What’s the difference? You don\\'t smoke?\" \"Stopped in June,\" I\\nsaid. \"How come?\" \"It was a pain. I hated running out of smokes in the middle of the\\nnight. I don’t like having something control me that way.\" \"You\\'re very clear about what you like and what you don\\'t like,\" she\\nsaid. \"Maybe so,\" I said. \"Maybe that\\'s why people don\\'t like me. Never\\nhave.\" \"It\\'s because you show it,\" she said. \"You make it obvious you don’t\\ncare whether people like you or not. That makes some people angry.\"\\nShe spoke in a near mumble, chin in hand. \"But I like talking to you.\\nThe way you talk is so unusual. \"I don\\'t like having something control\\nme that way\\'.\" I helped her wash the dishes. Standing next to her, I wiped as she\\nwashed, and stacked everything on the worktop. \"So,\" I said, \"your\\nfamily\\'s out today?\" \"My mother\\'s in her grave. She died two years ago.\" \"Yeah, I heard\\nthat part.\" \"My sister\\'s on a date with her fiance. Probably on a drive. Her\\nboyfriend works for some car company. He loves cars. I \\ndon\\'t\\n love\\ncars.\" Midori stopped talking and washed. I stopped talking and wiped. \"And then there\\'s my father,\" she said after some time had gone by.\\n\"Right,\" I said. \"He went off to Uruguay in June last year and he\\'s been there ever\\nsince.\" \"Uruguay?! Why Uruguay?\" \"He was thinking of settling there, believe it or not. An old army\\nbuddy of his has a farm there. All of a sudden, my father announces\\nhe\\'s going, too, that there\\'s no limit to what he can do in Uruguay, and\\nhe gets on a plane and that\\'s that. We tried hard to stop him, like,\\n\"Why do you want to go to a place like that? You can\\'t speak the\\nlanguage, you\\'ve hardly ever left Tokyo.\\' But he wouldn\\'t listen.\\nLosing my mother was a real shock to him. I mean, it made him a little cuckoo. That\\'s how much he loved her. Really.\" There was not much I could say in reply. I stared at Midori with my\\nmouth open. \"What do you think he said to my sister and me when our mother\\ndied? \"I would much rather have lost the two of you than her.’ It\\nknocked the wind out of me. I couldn’t say a word. You know what I\\nmean? You just can\\'t say something like that. OK, he lost the woman\\nhe loved, his partner for life. I understand the pain, the sadness, the\\nheartbreak. I pity him. But you don\\'t tell the daughters you fathered\\n\"You should have died in her place\\'. I mean, that\\'s just too terrible.\\nDon\\'t you agree?\" \"Yeah, I see your point.\" \"That\\'s one wound that will never go away,\" she said, shaking her\\nhead. \"But anyway, everyone in my family\\'s a little different. We\\'ve\\nall got something just a little bit strange.\" \"So it seems,\" I said. \"Still, it is wonderful for two people to love each other, don\\'t you\\nthink? I mean, for a man to love his wife so much he can tell his\\ndaughters they should have died in her place\\n\"Maybe so, now that you put it that way.\" \"And then he dumps the two of us and runs off to Uruguay.\" I wiped another dish without replying. After the last one, Midori put\\neverything back in the cabinets. \"So, have you heard from your father?\" I asked. \"One postcard. In March. But what does he write? \"It\\'s hot here\\' or\\n\"The fruit\\'s not as good as I expected\\'. Stuff like that. I mean, give me\\na break! One stupid picture of a donkey! He’s lost his marbles! He\\ndidn\\'t even say whether he’d met that guy - that friend of his or\\nwhatever. He did add near the end that once he’s settled he’ll send for\\nme and my sister, but not a word since then. And he never answers our\\nletters.\" \"What would you do if your father said \"Come to Uruguay’?\" \"I\\'d go and have a look around at least. It might be fun. My sister says\\nshe’d absolutely refuse. She can\\'t stand dirty things and dirty places.\" \"Is Uruguay dirty?\" \"Who knows? \\nShe\\n thinks it is. Like the roads are full of donkey shit\\nand it\\'s swarming with flies, and the toilets don\\'t work, and lizards and\\nscorpions crawl all over the place. She maybe saw a film like that. She\\ncan\\'t stand flies, either. All she wants to do is drive through scenic\\nplaces in fancy cars.\" \"No way.\" \"I mean, what\\'s wrong with Uruguay? I’d go.\" \"So who\\'s running the\\nshop?\" \"My sister, but she hates it. We have an uncle in the neighbourhood\\nwho helps out and makes deliveries. And I help when I have time. A\\nbookshop\\'s not exactly hard labour, so we can manage. If it gets to be\\ntoo much, we\\'ll sell the place.\" \"Do you like your father?\" Midori shook her head. \"Not especially.\" \"So how can you follow him\\nto Uruguay?\" \"I believe in him.\" \"Believe in him?\" \"yeah. I\\'m not that fond of him, but I believe in my father. How can \\nI not\\n believe in a man who gives up his house, his kids, his\\nwork, and runs off to Uruguay from the shock of losing his wife? Do\\nyou see what I mean?\" I sighed. \"Sort of, but not really.\" Midori laughed and patted me on the back. \"Never mind,\" she said. \"It\\nreally doesn\\'t matter.\" One weird thing after another came up that Sunday afternoon. A fire\\nbroke out near Midori\\'s house and, when we went up to the third-floor\\nlaundry deck to watch, we sort of kissed. It sounds stupid when I put it\\nlike that, but that was how things worked out. We were drinking coffee after the meal and talking about the university when we heard sirens. They got louder and louder and\\nseemed to be increasing in number. Lots of people ran past the shop,\\nsome of them shouting. Midori went to a room facing the street,\\nopened the window and looked down. \"Wait here a minute,\" she said\\nand disappeared; after which I heard feet pounding up stairs. I sat there drinking coffee alone and trying to remember where\\nUruguay was. Let\\'s see, Brazil was over here, and Venezuela there,\\nand Colombia somewhere over here, but I couldn\\'t recall the location\\nof Uruguay. A few minutes later Midori came down and urged me to\\nhurry somewhere with her. I followed her to the end of the hall and\\nclimbed a steep, narrow stairway to a wooden deck with bamboo\\nlaundry poles. The deck was higher than most of the surrounding\\nrooftops and gave a good view of the neighbourhood. Huge clouds of\\nblack smoke shot up from a place three or four houses away and\\nflowed with the breeze out towards the high street. A burning smell\\nfilled the air. \"It’s Sakamoto\\'s place,\" said Midori, leaning over the railing. \"They\\nused to make traditional door fittings and stuff. They went out of\\nbusiness some time ago, though.\" I leaned over the railing with her and strained to see what was going\\non. A three-storey building blocked our view of the fire, but there\\nseemed to be three or four fire engines over there working on the\\nblaze. No more than two of them could squeeze into the narrow lane\\nwhere the house was burning, the rest standing by on the high street.\\nThe usual crowd of gawkers filled the area. \"Hey, maybe you should gather your valuables together and get ready\\nto evacuate this place,\" I said to Midori. \"The wind\\'s blowing the other\\nway now, but it could change any time, and you\\'ve got a petrol station\\nright there. I\\'ll help you pack.\" \"What valuables?\" said Midori. \"Well, you must have something you’d want to save - bankbooks,\\nseals, legal papers, stuff like that. Emergency cash.\" \"Forget it. I\\'m not running away.\" \"Even if this place bums?\" \"You heard me. I don\\'t mind dying.\" I looked her in the eye, and she looked straight at me. I couldn’t tell if\\nshe was serious or joking. We stayed like that for a while, and soon I\\nstopped worrying. \"OK,\" I said. \"I get it. I\\'ll stay with you.\" \"You\\'ll die with me?\" Midori asked with shining eyes. \"No way,\" I said. \"I’ll run if it gets dangerous. If you want to die, you\\ncan do it alone.\" \"Cold-hearted bastard!\" \"I’m not going to die with you just because you made lunch for me. Of\\ncourse, if it had been dinner. ..\" \"Oh, well ... Anyway, let’s stay here and watch for a while. We can\\nsing songs. And if something bad happens, we can think about it\\nthen.\" \"Sing songs?\" Midori brought two floor pillows, four cans of beer and a guitar from\\ndownstairs. We drank and watched the black smoke rising. She\\nstrummed and sang. I asked her if she didn\\'t think this might anger the\\nneighbours. Drinking beer and singing while you watched a local fire\\nfrom the laundry deck didn’t seem like the most admirable behaviour I\\ncould think of. \"Forget it,\" she said. \"We never worry about what the neighbours\\nmight think.\" She sang some of the folk songs she had played with her group. I\\nwould have been hard pressed to say she was good, but she did seem\\nto enjoy her own music. She went through all the old standards -\\n\"Lemon Tree\", \"Puff (The Magic Dragon)\", \"Five Hundred Miles\",\\n\"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\", \"Michael, Row the Boat\\nAshore\". At first she tried to get me to sing bass harmony, but I was so\\nbad she gave up and sang alone to her heart\\'s content. I worked on my beer and listened to her sing and kept an eye on the fire. It flared up\\nand died down several times. People were yelling and giving orders. A\\nnewspaper helicopter clattered overhead, took photographs and flew\\naway. I worried that we might be in the picture. A policeman\\nscreamed through a loudspeaker for bystanders to get back. A little kid\\nwas crying for his mother. Glass shattered somewhere. Before long\\nthe wind began shifting unpredictably, and white ash flakes fell out of\\nthe air around us, but Midori went on sipping and singing. After she\\nhad gone through most of the songs she knew, she sang an odd one\\nthat she said she had written herself: I\\'d love to cook a stew for you, But I have no pot. I\\'d love to knit a scarf for you, But I have no wool. I\\'d love to write a poem for you, But I have no pen. \"It\\'s called \"I Have Nothing\\',\" Midori announced. It was a truly\\nterrible song, both words and music. I listened to this musical mess thinking that the house would blow\\napart in the explosion if the petrol station caught fire. Tired of singing,\\nMidori put down her guitar and slumped against my shoulder like a\\ncat in the sun. \"How did you like my song?\" she asked. I answered cautiously, \"It was unique and original and very expressive\\nof your personality.\" \"Thanks,\" she said. \"The theme is that I have nothing.\" \"Yeah, I kind\\nof thought so.\" \"You know,\" she said, \"when my mother died. ..\" \"Yeah?\" \"I didn\\'t feel the least bit sad.\" \"Oh.\" \"And I didn\\'t feel sad when my father left, either.\" \"Really?\" \"It\\'s true. Don\\'t you think I\\'m terrible? Cold-hearted?\" \"I\\'m sure you\\nhave your reasons.\" \"My reasons. Hmm. Things were pretty complicated in this house. But\\nI always thought, I mean, they\\'re my mother and father, of course I\\'d\\nbe sad if they died or I never saw them again. But it didn\\'t happen that\\nway. I didn\\'t feel anything. Not sad, not lonely. I hardly even think of\\nthem. Sometimes I’ll have dreams, though. Sometimes my mother will\\nbe glaring at me out of the darkness and she\\'ll accuse me of being\\nhappy she died. But I\\'m \\nnot\\n happy she died. I\\'m just not very sad. And\\nto tell the truth, I never shed a single tear. I cried all night when my\\ncat died, though, when I was little.\" Why so much smoke? I wondered. I couldn\\'t see flames, and the\\nburning area didn’t seem to be spreading. There was just this column\\nof smoke winding up into the sky. What could have kept burning so\\nlong? \"But I’m not the only one to blame,\" Midori continued. \"It’s true I have\\na cold streak. I recognize that. But if they - my father and mother - had\\nloved me a little more, I would have been able to feel more - to feel\\nreal sadness, for example.\" \"Do you think you weren\\'t loved enough?\" She tilted her head and looked at me. Then she gave a sharp, little nod.\\n\"Somewhere between \"not enough\\' and \"not at all\\'. I was always\\nhungry for love. Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get\\nmy fill of it - to be fed so much love I couldn\\'t take any more. Just\\nonce. But they never gave that to me. Never, not once. If I tried to\\ncuddle up and beg for something, they\\'d just shove me away and yell\\nat me. \"No! That costs too much!’ It’s all I ever heard. So I made up\\nmy mind I was going to find someone who would love me unconditionally 365 days a year. I was still in primary school at the time, but\\nI made up my mind once and for all.\" \"Wow,\" I said. \"And did your search pay off?\" \"That’s the hard part,\" said Midori. She watched the rising smoke for a while, thinking. \"I guess I\\'ve been waiting so long I\\'m looking for\\nperfection. That makes it tough.\" \"Waiting for the perfect love?\" \"No, even I know better than that. I\\'m looking for selfishness. Perfect\\nselfishness. Like, say I tell you I want to eat strawberry shortbread.\\nAnd you stop everything you\\'re doing and run out and buy it for me.\\nAnd you come back out of breath and get down on your knees and\\nhold this strawberry shortbread out to me. And I say I don\\'t want it\\nany more and throw it out of the window. That\\'s what I\\'m looking\\nfor.\" \"I\\'m not sure that has anything to do with love,\" I said with some\\namazement. \"It does,\" she said. \"You just don\\'t know it. There are times in a girl’s\\nlife when things like that are incredibly important.\" \"Things like throwing strawberry shortbread out of the window?\"\\n\"Exactly. And when I do it, I want the man to apologize to me. \"Now I\\nsee, Midori. What a fool I’ve been! I should have known that you\\nwould lose your desire for strawberry shortbread. I have all the\\nintelligence and sensitivity of a piece of donkey shit. To make it up to\\nyou. I’ll go out and buy you something else. What would you like?\\nChocolate mousse? Cheesecake?’\" \"So then what?\" \"So then I\\'d give him all the love he deserves for what he’s done.\"\\n\"Sounds crazy to me.\" \"Well, to \\nme,\\n that’s what love is. Not that anyone can understand me,\\nthough.\" Midori gave her head a little shake against my shoulder. \"For\\na certain kind of person, love begins from something tiny or silly.\\nFrom something like that or it doesn\\'t begin at all.\" \"I\\'ve never met a girl who thinks like you.\" \"A lot of people tell me that,\" she said, digging at a cuticle. \"But it\\'s\\nthe only way I know how to think. Seriously. I\\'m just telling you what\\nI believe. It\\'s never crossed my mind that my way of thinking is different from other people\\'s. I\\'m not \\ntrying\\n to be different. But when I\\nspeak out honestly, everybody thinks I\\'m kidding or play-acting.\\nWhen that happens, I feel like everything\\'s such a pain!\" \"And you want to let yourself die in a fire?\" \"Hey, no, that\\'s different. It\\'s just a matter of curiosity.\" \"What? Dying in a fire?\" \"No, I just wanted to see how you\\'d react,\" Midori said. \"But, I\\'m not\\nafraid of dying. Really. Like here. I\\'d just be overcome with smoke\\nand lose consciousness and die before I knew it. That doesn\\'t frighten\\nme at all, compared to the way I saw my mother and a few relatives\\ndie. \\nAll\\n my relatives die after suffering from some terrible illness. It\\'s\\nin the blood, I guess. It\\'s always \\na long, long\\n process, and at the end\\nyou almost can\\'t tell whether the person is alive or dead. All that\\'s left\\nis pain and suffering.\" Midori put a Marlboro between her lips and lit it. \"That\\'s the kind of death that frightens me. The shadow of death\\nslowly, slowly eats away at the region of life, and before you know it\\neverything\\'s dark and you can\\'t see, and the people around you think\\nof you as more dead than alive. I hate that. I couldn’t stand it.\" Another half hour and the fire was out. They had apparently kept it\\nfrom spreading and prevented any injuries. All but one of the fire\\nengines returned to base, and the crowd dispersed, buzzing with\\nconversation. One police car remained to direct the traffic, its blue\\nlight spinning. Two crows had settled on nearby lamp-posts to observe\\nthe activity below. Midori seemed drained of energy. Limp, she stared at the sky and\\nbarely spoke. \"Tired?\" I asked. \"Not really,\" she said. \"I just sort of let myself go limp and spaced out.\\nFirst time in a long time.\" She looked into my eyes, and I into hers. I put my arm around her and\\nkissed her. The slightest twinge went through her shoulders, and then\\nshe relaxed and closed her eyes for several seconds. The early autumn\\nsun cast the shadow of her lashes on her cheek, and I could see it\\ntrembling in outline. It was a soft and gentle kiss, one not meant to lead beyond itself. I\\nwould probably not have kissed Midori that day if we hadn\\'t spent the\\nafternoon on the laundry deck in the sun, drinking beer and watching a\\nfire, and she no doubt felt the same. After a long time of watching the\\nglittering rooftops and the smoke and the red dragonflies and other\\nthings, we had felt something warm and close, and we both probably\\nwanted, half-consciously, to preserve that mood in some form. It was\\nthat kind of kiss. But as with all kisses, it was not without a certain\\nelement of danger. The first to speak was Midori. She held my hand and told me, with\\nwhat seemed like some difficulty, that she was seeing someone. I said\\nthat I had sensed as much. \"Do you have a girl you like?\" she asked. \"I do,\" I said. \"But you\\'re always free on Sundays, right?\" \"It\\'s very complicated,\" I\\nsaid. And then I realized that the brief spell of the early autumn afternoon\\nhad vanished. At five I said I had to go to work and suggested that Midori come with\\nme for a snack. She said she had to stay home in case the phone rang. \"I hate waiting at home all day for a call. When I spend the day alone,\\nI feel as if my flesh is rotting little by little - rotting and melting until\\nthere\\'s nothing left but a green puddle that gets sucked down into the\\nearth. And all that stays behind are my clothes. That\\'s how it feels to\\nme, waiting indoors all day.\" \"I\\'ll keep you company next time you\\nhave to wait for a call,\" I said. ’As long as lunch is included.\" \"Great,\" she said. \"I\\'ll arrange another fire for dessert.\" Midori didn’t come to the next day\\'s History of Drama lecture. I went\\nto the cafeteria afterwards and ate a cold, tasteless lunch alone. Then I\\nsat in the sun and observed the campus scene. Two women students\\nnext to me were carrying on a long conversation, standing the whole\\ntime. One cradled a tennis racquet to her breast with all the loving care\\nshe might give a baby, while the other held some books and a Leonard\\nBernstein LP Both were pretty and obviously enjoying their\\ndiscussion. From the direction of the student club building came the\\nsound of a bass voice practising scales. Here and there stood groups of\\nfour or five students expressing whatever opinions they happened to\\nhold, laughing and shouting to one another. There were skateboarders\\nin the car park. A professor with a leather briefcase in his arms\\ncrossed the car park, avoiding them. In the quadrangle a helmeted girl\\nstudent knelt on the ground, painting huge characters on a sign with\\nsomething about American imperialism invading Asia. It was the\\nusual midday university scene, but as I sat watching it with renewed\\nattention, I became aware of something. In his or her own way,\\neveryone I saw before me looked happy. Whether they were really\\nhappy or just looked it, I couldn’t tell. But they did look happy on this\\npleasant early afternoon in late September, and because of that I felt a\\nkind of loneliness new to me, as if I were the only one here who was\\nnot truly part of the scene. Come to think of it, what scene \\nhad\\n I been a part of in recent years?\\nThe last one I could remember was a pool hall near the harbour, where\\nKizuki and I played pool together in a spirit of total friendship. Kizuki\\ndied that night, and ever since a cold, stiffening wind had come\\nbetween me and the world. This boy Kizuki: what had his existence\\nmeant to me? To this question I could find no answer. All I knew -\\nwith absolute certainty - was that Kizuki\\'s death had robbed me for ever of some part of my adolescence. But what that meant, and what\\nwould come of it, were far beyond my understanding. I sat there for a long time, watching the campus and the people\\npassing through it, and hoping, too, that I might see Midori. But she\\nnever appeared, and when the noon break ended, I went to the library\\nto prepare for my German class. Nagasawa came to my room that Saturday afternoon and suggested we\\nhave one of our nights on the town. He would arrange an overnight\\npass for me. I said I would go. I had been feeling especially muddle-\\nheaded for the past week and was ready to sleep with anybody, it\\ndidn’t matter who. Late in the afternoon I showered and shaved and put on fresh clothes -\\na polo shirt and cotton jacket - then had dinner with Nagasawa in the\\ndining hall and the two of us caught a bus to Shinjuku. We walked\\naround a lively area for a while, then went to one of our usual bars and\\nsat there waiting for a likely pair of girls. The girls tended to come in\\npairs to this bar - except on this particular evening. We stayed there\\nalmost two hours, sipping whisky and sodas at a rate that kept us\\nsober. Finally, two friendly-looking girls took seats at the bar,\\nordering a gimlet and a margarita. Nagasawa approached them straight\\naway, but they said they were waiting for their boyfriends. Still, the\\nfour of us enjoyed a pleasant chat until their dates showed up.\\nNagasawa took me to another bar to try our luck, a small\\nplace in a kind of cul-de-sac, where most of the customers were\\nalready drunk and noisy. A group of three girls occupied a table at the\\nback. We joined them and enjoyed a little conversation, the five of us\\ngetting into a nice mood, but when Nagasawa suggested we go\\nsomewhere else for a drink, the girls said it was almost curfew time\\nand they had to go back to their dorms. So much for our \"luck\". We\\ntried one more place with the same result. For some reason, the girls\\nwere just not coming our way. At 11.30 Nagasawa was ready to give up. \"Sorry I dragged \\nyou\\n around\\nfor nothing,\" he said. \"No problem,\" I said. \"It was worth it to me just to see you have your\\noff days sometimes, too.\" \"Maybe once a year,\" he admitted. In fact, I didn’t care about getting laid any more. Wandering around\\nShinjuku on a noisy Saturday night, observing the mysterious energy\\ncreated by a mixture of sex and alcohol, I began to feel that my own\\ndesire was a puny thing. \"What are you going to do now, Watanabe?\" \"Maybe go to an all-nighter,\" I said. \"I haven\\'t seen a film in ages.\" \"I\\'ll be going to Hatsumi\\'s then,\" said Nagasawa. \"Do you mind?\" \"No way,\" I said. \"Why should I mind?\" \"If you’d like, I could introduce you to a girl who\\'d let you spend the\\nnight.\" \"Nah, I really am in the mood for a film.\" \"Sorry,\" said Nagasawa. \"I\\'ll make it up to you some time.\" And he\\ndisappeared into the crowd. I went into a fast food place for a\\ncheeseburger and some coffee to kill the buzz, then went to see \\nThe\\nGraduate\\n in an old rep house. I didn’t think it was all that good, but I\\ndidn\\'t have anything better to do, so I stayed and watched it again.\\nEmerging from the cinema at four in the morning, I wandered along\\nthe chilly streets of Shinjuku, thinking. When I tired of walking, I went to an all-night cafe and waited with a\\nbook and a cup of coffee for the morning trains to start. Before long,\\nthe place became crowded with people who, like me, were waiting for\\nthose first trains. A waiter came to ask me apologetically if I would\\nmind sharing my table. I said it would be all right. It didn\\'t matter to\\nme who sat across from me: I was just reading a book. My companions at the table turned out to be two girls. They looked\\nabout my age. Neither of them was a knockout, but they weren\\'t bad.\\nBoth were reserved in the way they dressed and made up: they were definitely not the type to be wandering around Shinjuku at five in the\\nmorning. I guessed they had just happened to miss the last train. They\\nseemed relieved to sit with me: I was neatly dressed, had shaved in the\\nevening, and to cap it all I was absorbed in Thomas Mann\\'s \\nThe Magic\\nMountain. One of the girls was on the large side. She wore a grey parka and\\nwhite jeans, carried a large vinyl pocketbook, and had large, shellshaped earrings. Her friend was a small girl with glasses. She wore a\\nblue cardigan over a checked shirt and had a turquoise ring. The\\nsmaller one had a habit of taking off her glasses and pressing her eyes\\nwith her fingertips. Both girls ordered \\ncafe au lait\\n and cake, which it took them some time\\nto consume as they carried on what seemed like a serious discussion in\\nhushed tones. The large girl tilted her head several times, while the\\nsmall one shook hers just as often. I couldn\\'t make out what they were\\nsaying because of the loud stereo playing Marvin Gaye or the Bee\\nGees or something, but it seemed the small girl was angry or upset and\\nthe large girl was trying to comfort her. I alternated passages of my\\nbook with glances in their direction. Clutching her shoulder bag to her breast, the smaller girl went to the\\nladies\\', at which point her companion spoke to me. \"I\\'m sorry to bother you, but I wonder if you might know of ally bars\\nin the neighbourhood that would still be serving drinks?\" Taken off guard, I set my book aside and asked, \"After five o\\'clock in\\nthe morning?\" \"Yes ... \"If you ask me, at 5.20 in the morning, most people are on\\ntheir way home to get sober and go to bed.\" \"Yes, I realize that,\" she said, a bit embarrassed, \"but my friend says\\nshe has to have a drink. It\\'s kind of important.\" \"There\\'s probably nothing much you can do but go home and have a\\ndrink.\" \"But I have to catch a 7.30 train to Nagano.\" \"So find a vending machine and a nice place to sit. It\\'s about all you\\ncan do.\" \"I know this is asking a lot, but could you come with us? Two girls\\nalone really can\\'t do something like that.\" I had had a number of unusual experiences in Shinjuku, but I had\\nnever before been invited to have a drink with two strange girls at 5.20\\nin the morning. Refusing would have been more trouble than it was\\nworth, and time was no problem, so I bought an armload of sake and\\nsnacks from a nearby machine, and the three of us went to an empty\\ncar park by the west exit of the station to hold an impromptu drinking\\nparty. The girls told me they had become friends working at a travel agency.\\nBoth of them had graduated from college this year and started their\\nfirst jobs. The small one had a boyfriend she had been seeing for a\\nyear, but had recently discovered he was sleeping with another girl\\nand she had taken it hard. The larger one was supposed to have left for\\nthe mountains of Nagano last night for her brother\\'s wedding, but she\\nhad decided to spend the night with her depressed friend and take the\\nfirst express on Sunday morning. \"It\\'s too bad what you\\'re going through,\" I said to the small one, \"but\\nhow did you find out your boyfriend was sleeping with someone\\nelse?\" Taking little sips of sake, the girl tore at some weeds underfoot. \"I\\ndidn\\'t have to work anything out,\" she said. \"I opened his door, and\\nthere he was, doing it.\" \"When was that?\" \"The night before last.\" \"No way. The door was unlocked?\" \"Right.\" \"I wonder why he didn\\'t lock it?\" \"How the hell should I know?\" \"Yeah, how’s she supposed to feel?\" said the larger one, who seemed truly concerned for her friend. \"What a shock it must have been for\\nher. Don\\'t you think it’s terrible?\" \"I really can’t say,\" I answered. \"You ought to have a good talk with\\nyour boyfriend. Then it’s a question of whether you forgive him or\\nnot.\" \"Nobody knows how I feel,\" spat out the little one, still tearing grass. A flock of crows appeared from the west and sailed over a big\\ndepartment store. It was daylight now. The time for the Uain to\\nNagano was approaching, so we gave what was left of the sake to a\\nhomeless guy downstairs at the west exit, bought platform tickets and\\nwent in to see the big girl off. After the Uain pulled out of sight, the\\nsmall girl and I somehow ended up going to a nearby hotel. Neither of\\nus was particularly dying to sleep with the other, but it seemed\\nnecessary to bring things to a close. I undressed first and sat in the bath drinking beer with a vengeance.\\nShe got in with me and did the same, the two of us sttetched out and\\nguzzling beer in silence. We couldn\\'t seem to get drunk, though, and\\nneither of us was sleepy. Her skin was \\nvery\\n fair and smooth, and she\\nhad beautiful legs. I complimented her on her legs, but her \"Thanks\"\\nwas little more than a grunt. Once we were in bed, though, she was like a different person. She\\nresponded to the slightest touch of my hands, writhing and moaning.\\nWhen I went inside her, she dug her nails into my back, and as her\\norgasm approached she called out another man’s name exactly 16\\ntimes. I concenUated on counting them as a way to delay my own\\norgasm. Then the two of us fell asleep. She was gone when I woke at 12.30.1 found no note of any kind. One\\nside of my head felt sUangely heavy from having drunk at an odd\\nhour. I took a shower to wake myself, shaved and sat in a chair, naked,\\ndrinking a bottle of juice from the fridge and reviewing in order the\\nevents of the night before. Each scene felt unreal and sUangely distant,\\nas though I were viewing it through two or three layers of glass, but the events had undoubtedly happened to me. The beer glasses were\\nstill sitting on the table, and a used toothbrush lay by the sink. I ate a light lunch in Shinjuku and went to a telephone box to call\\nMidori Kobayashi on the off chance that she might be home alone\\nwaiting for a call again today. I let it ring 15 times but no one\\nanswered. I tried again 20 minutes later with the same results. Then I\\ntook a bus back to the dorm. A special delivery letter was waiting for\\nme in the letterbox by the entry. It was from Naoko. '"

       "'m\\n \\nsf Thanks for your letter,\\n wrote Naoko. Her family had forwarded it\\nhere,\\n she said. Far from upsetting her, its arrival had made her very\\nhappy, and in fact she had been on the point of writing to me herself.\\nHaving read that much, I opened the window, took off my jacket and\\nsat on the bed. I could hear pigeons cooing in a nearby roost. The\\nbreeze stirred the curtains. Holding the seven pages of writing paper\\nfrom Naoko, I gave myself up to an endless stream of feelings. It\\nseemed as if the colours of the real world around me had begun to\\ndrain away from my having done nothing more than read a few lines\\nshe had written. I closed my eyes and spent a long time collecting my\\nthoughts. Finally, after one deep breath, I continued reading. It\\'s almost four months since I came here,\\n she went on. I\\'ve thought a lot about you in that time. The more I\\'ve thought, the\\nmore I\\'ve come to feel that I was unfair to you. I probably should have\\nbeen a better, fairer person when it came to the way I treated you. This may not be the most normal way to look at things, though. Girls\\nmy age \\nnever\\n use the word \"fair\". Ordinary girls as young as I am are\\nbasically indifferent to whether things are fair or not. The central question for them is not whether something is fair but whether or not\\nit\\'s beautiful or will make them happy. \"Fair\" is a man\\'s word, finally,\\nbut I can\\'t help feeling that it is also exactly the right word for me\\nnow. And because questions of beauty and happiness have become\\nsuch difficult and convoluted propositions for me now, I suspect, I\\nfind myself clinging instead to other standards - like, whether or not\\nsomething is fair or honest or universally true. In any case, though, I believe that I have not been fair to you and that,\\nas a result, I must have led you around in circles and hurt you deeply.\\nIn doing so, however, I have led myself around in circles and hurt\\nmyself just as deeply. I say this not as an excuse or a means of selfjustification but because it is true. If I have left a wound inside you, it\\nis not just your wound but mine as well. So please try not to hate me. I\\nam a flawed human being - a far more flawed human being than you\\nrealize. Which is precisely why I do not want you to hate me. Because\\nif you were to do that, I would really go to pieces. I can\\'t do what you\\ncan do: I can\\'t slip inside my shell and wait for things to pass. I don\\'t\\nknow for a fact that you are really like that, but sometimes you give\\nme that impression. I often envy that in you, which may be why I led\\nyou around in circles so much. This may be an over-analytical way of looking at things. Don\\'t you\\nagree? The therapy they perform here is certainly not over-analytical,\\nbut when you are under treatment for several months the way I am\\nhere, like it or not, you become more or less analytical. \"This was\\ncaused by that, and that means this, because of which such-and-such.\"\\nLike that. I can\\'t tell whether this kind of analysis is trying to simplify\\nthe world or complicate it. In any case, I myself feel that I am far closer to recovery than I once\\nwas, and people here tell me this is true. This is the first time in a long\\nwhile I have been able to sit down and calmly write a letter. The one I\\nwrote you in July was something I had to squeeze out of me (though,\\nto tell the truth, I don\\'t remember what I wrote - was it terrible?), but this time I am very, very calm. Clean air, a quiet world cut off from\\nthe outside, a daily schedule for living, regular exercise: those are\\nwhat I needed, it seems. How wonderful it is to be able to write\\nsomeone a letter! To feel like conveying your thoughts to a person, to\\nsit at your desk and pick up a pen, to put your thoughts into words like\\nthis is truly marvellous. Of course, once I \\ndo\\n put them into words, I\\nfind I can only express a fraction of what I want to say, but that\\'s all\\nright. I\\'m happy just to be able to feel I want to write to someone. And\\nso I am writing to you. It\\'s 7.30 in the evening. I\\'ve had my dinner and\\nI\\'ve just finished my bath. The place is silent, and it\\'s pitch black\\noutside. I can\\'t see a single light through the window. I usually have a\\nclear view of the stars from here, but not today, with the clouds.\\nEveryone here knows a lot about the stars, and they tell me \"That\\'s\\nVirgo\" or \"That\\'s Sagittarius\". They probably leam whether they want\\nto or not because there\\'s nothing to do here once the sun goes down.\\nWhich is also why they know so much about birds and flowers and\\ninsects. Speaking to them, I realize how ignorant I was about such\\nthings, which is kind of nice. There are about 70 people living here. In addition, the staff (doctors,\\nnurses, office staff, etc.) come to just over 20. It\\'s such a wide-open\\nplace, these are not big numbers at all. Far from it: it might be more\\naccurate to say the place is on the empty side. It\\'s big and filled with\\nnature and everybody lives quietly - so quietly you sometimes feel\\nthat this is the normal, real world, which of course it\\'s not. We can\\nhave it this way because we live here under certain preconditions. I play tennis and basketball. Basketball teams are made up of both\\nstaff and (I hate the word, but there\\'s no way around it) patients. When\\nI\\'m absorbed in a game, though, I lose track of who are the patients\\nand who are staff. This is kind of strange. I know this will \\nsound\\nstrange, but when I look at the people around me during a game, they\\nall look equally deformed. I said this one day to the doctor in charge of my case, and he told me that, in a sense, what I was feeling was right, that we are in here not to\\ncorrect the deformation but to accustom ourselves to it: that one of our\\nproblems was our inability to recognize and accept our own\\ndeformities. Just as each person has certain idiosyncrasies in the way\\nhe or she walks, people have idiosyncrasies in the way they think and\\nfeel and see things, and though you might want to correct them, it\\ndoesn\\'t happen overnight, and if you try to force the issue in one case,\\nsomething else might go funny. He gave me a very simplified\\nexplanation, of course, and it\\'s just one small part of the problems we\\nhave, but I think I understand what he was trying to say. It may well\\nbe that we can never fully adapt to our own deformities. Unable to\\nfind a place inside ourselves for the \\\\ery real pain and suffering that\\nthese deformities cause, we come here to get away from such things.\\nAs long as we are here, we can get by without hurting others or being\\nhurt by them because we know that we are \"deformed\". That\\'s what\\ndistinguishes us from the outside world: most people go about their\\nlives unconscious of their deformities, while in this little world of ours\\nthe deformities themselves are a precondition. Just as Indians wear\\nfeathers on their heads to show what tribe they belong to, we wear our\\ndeformities in the open. And we live quietly so as not to hurt one\\nanother. In addition to playing sports, we all participate in growing vegetables:\\ntomatoes, aubergines, cucumbers, watermelons, strawberries, spring\\nonions, cabbage, daikon radishes, and so on and on. We grow just\\nabout everything. We use greenhouses, too. The people here know a\\nlot about vegetable farming, and they put a lot of energy into it. They\\nread books on the subject and call in experts and talk from morning to\\nnight about which fertilizer to use and the condition of the soil and\\nstuff like that. I have come to love growing vegetables. It\\'s great to\\nwatch different fruits and vegetables getting bigger and bigger each\\nday. Have you ever grown watermelons? They swell up, just like\\nsome kind of little animals. We eat freshly picked fruits and vegetables every day. They also serve\\nmeat and fish of course, but when you\\'re living here you feel less and\\nless like eating those because the vegetables are so fresh and\\ndelicious. Sometimes we go out and gather wild plants and\\nmushrooms. We have experts on that kind of thing (come to think of\\nit, this place is crawling with experts) who tell us which plants to pick\\nand which to avoid. As a result of all this, I\\'ve gained over six pounds\\nsince I got here. My weight is just about perfect, thanks to the exercise\\nand the good eating on a regular schedule. When we\\'re not farming, we read or listen to music or knit. We don\\'t\\nhave TV or radio, but we do have a very decent library with books and\\nrecords. The record collection has everything from Mahler\\nsymphonies to the Beatles, and I\\'m always borrowing records to listen\\nto in my room. The one real problem with this place is that once you\\'re here you don\\'t\\nwant to leave - or you\\'re afraid to leave. As long as we\\'re here, we feel\\ncalm and peaceful. Our deformities seem natural. We think we\\'ve\\nrecovered. But we can never be sure that the outside world will accept\\nus in the same way. My doctor says it\\'s time I began having contact with \"outside people\"\\n- meaning normal people in the normal world. When he says that, the\\nonly face I see is yours. To tell the truth, I don’t want to see my\\nparents. They\\'re too upset over me, and seeing them puts me in a bad\\nmood. Plus, there are things I have to explain to )ou. I\\'m not sure \\nI\\ncan\\n explain them very well, but they\\'re important things I can\\'t go on\\navoiding any longer. Still, you shouldn\\'t feel that I\\'m a burden to you. The one thing I don\\'t\\nwant to be is a burden to anyone. I can sense the good feelings you\\nhave for me. They make me very happy. All I am doing in this letter is\\ntrying to convey that happiness to you. Those good feelings of yours\\nare probably just what I need at this point in my life. Please forgive\\nme if anything I\\'ve written here upsets you. As I said before, I am a far more flawed human being than you realize. I sometimes wonder: IF you and I had met under absolutely ordinary\\ncircumstances, and IF we had liked each other, what would have\\nhappened? IF I had been normal and you had been normal (which, of\\ncourse, you are) and there had been no Kizuki, what would have\\nhappened? Of course, this \"IF\" is way too big. I\\'m trying hard at least\\nto be fair and honest. It\\'s all I can do at this point. I hope to convey\\nsome small part of my feelings to you this way. Unlike an ordinary hospital, this place has free visiting hours. As long\\nas you call the day before, you can come any time. You can even eat\\nwith me, and there\\'s a place for you to stay. Please come and see me\\nsometime when it\\'s convenient for you. I look forward to seeing you.\\nI\\'m enclosing a map. Sorry this turned into such a long letter. I read Naoko\\'s letter all the way through, and then I read it again.\\nAfter that I went downstairs, bought a Coke from the vending\\nmachine, and drank it while reading the letter one more time. I put the\\nseven pages of writing paper back into the envelope and laid it on my\\ndesk. My name and address had been written on the pink envelope in\\nperfect, tiny characters that were just a bit too precisely formed for\\nthose of a girl. I sat at my desk, studying the envelope. The return\\naddress on the back said \\nAmi Hostel.\\n An odd name. I thought about it\\nfor a few minutes, concluding that the \"ami\" must be from the French word\\nfor \"friend\". After putting the letter away in my desk drawer, I changed clothes and\\nwent out. I was afraid that if I stayed near the letter I would end up\\nreading it 10, 20, who knew how many times? I walked the streets of\\nTokyo on Sunday without a destination in mind, as I had always done\\nwith Naoko. I wandered from one street to the next, recalling her letter\\nline by line and mulling each sentence over as best I could. When the\\nsun went down, I returned to the dorm and made a long-distance call to the Ami Hostel. A woman receptionist answered and asked my\\nbusiness. I asked if it might be possible for me to visit Naoko the\\nfollowing afternoon. I left my name and she said I should call back in\\nhalf an hour. The same woman answered when I called back after dinner. It would\\nindeed be possible for me to see Naoko, she said. I thanked her, hung\\nup, and put a change of clothes and a few toiletries in my rucksack.\\nThen I picked up \\nThe Magic Mountain\\n again, reading and sipping\\nbrandy and waiting to get sleepy. Even so, I didn\\'t fall asleep until\\nafter one o\\'clock in the morning. \\n \\n \\n \\n As soon as I woke at seven o\\'clock on Monday morning, I washed my\\nface, shaved, and went straight to the dorm Head\\'s room without\\neating breakfast to say that I was going to be gone for two days hiking\\nin the hills. He was used to my taking short trips when I had free time,\\nand reacted without surprise. I took a crowded commuter train to\\nTokyo Station and bought a bullet-train ticket to Kyoto, literally\\njumping onto the first \\nHikari\\n express to pull out. I made do with\\ncoffee and a sandwich for breakfast and dozed for an hour. I arrived in Kyoto a few minutes before eleven. Following Naoko\\'s\\ninstructions, I took a city bus to a small terminal serving the northern\\nsuburbs. The next bus to my destination would not be leaving until\\n11.35, I was told, and the trip would take a little over an hour. I\\nbought a ticket and went to a bookshop across the street for a map.\\nBack in the waiting room, I studied the map to see if I could find\\nexactly where the Ami Hostel was located. It turned out to be much\\nfarther into the mountains than I had imagined. The bus would have to\\ncross several hills in its trek north, then turn around where the canyon\\nroad dead-ended and return to the city. My stop would be just before\\nthe end of the line. There was a footpath near the bus stop, according\\nto Naoko, and if I followed it for 20 minutes I would reach Ami\\nHostel. No wonder it was such a quiet place, if it was that deep in the mountains!\\nThe bus pulled out with about 20 passengers aboard, following the\\nKamo River through the north end of Kyoto. The tightly packed city\\nstreets gave way to more sparse housing, then fields and vacant land.\\nBlack tile roofs and vinyl -sided greenhouses caught the early autumn\\nsun and sent it back with a glare. When the bus entered the canyon,\\nthe driver began hauling the steering wheel this way and that to follow\\nthe twists and curves of the road, and I began to feel queasy. I could still taste my morning coffee. By the time the number of curves began\\nto decrease to the point where I felt some relief, the bus plunged into a\\nchilling cedar forest. The trees might have been old growth the way\\nthey towered over the road, blocking out the sun and covering\\neverything in gloomy shadows. The breeze flowing into the bus\\'s open\\nwindows turned suddenly cold, its dampness sharp against the skin.\\nThe valley road hugged the river bank, continuing so long through the\\ntrees it began to seem as if the whole world had been buried for ever\\nin cedar forest - at which point the forest ended, and we came to an\\nopen basin surrounded by mountain peaks. Broad, green farmland\\nspread out in all directions, and the river by the road looked bright and\\nclear. A single thread of white smoke rose in the distance. Some\\nhouses had laundry drying in the sun, and dogs were howling. Each\\nfarmhouse had firewood out front piled up to the eaves, usually with a\\ncat resting somewhere on the pile. The road was lined with such\\nhouses for a time, but I saw not a single person. The scenery repeated this pattern any number of times. The bus would\\nenter cedar forest, come out to a village, then go back into forest. It\\nwould stop at a village to let people off, but no one ever got on. Forty\\nminutes after leaving the city, the bus reached a mountain pass with a\\nwide-open view. The driver stopped the bus and announced that we\\nwould be waiting there for five or six minutes: people could step down\\nfrom the bus if they wished. There were only four passengers left now,\\nincluding me. We all got out and stretched or smoked and looked\\ndown at the panorama of Kyoto far below. The driver went off to one\\nside for a pee. A suntanned man in his early fifties who had boarded\\nthe bus with a big, rope-tied cardboard carton asked me if I was going\\nout to hike in the mountains. I said yes to keep things simple. Eventually another bus came climbing up from the other side of the\\npass and stopped next to ours. The driver got out, had a short talk with\\nour driver, and the two men climbed back into their buses. The four of\\nus returned to our seats, and the buses pulled out in opposite directions. It was not immediately clear to me why our bus had had to\\nwait for the other one, but a short way down the other side of the\\nmountain the road narrowed suddenly. Two big buses could never\\nhave passed each other on the road, and in fact passing ordinary cars\\ncoming in the other direction required a good deal of manoeuvring,\\nwith one or the other vehicle having to back up and squeeze into the\\noverhang of a curve. The villages along the road were far smaller now, and the level areas\\nunder cultivation even narrower. The mountain was steeper, its walls\\npressed closer to the bus windows. They seemed to have just as many\\ndogs as the other places, though, and the arrival of the bus would set\\noff a howling competition. At the stop where I got off, there was nothing - no houses, no fields,\\njust the bus stop sign, a little stream, and the trail opening. I slung my\\nrucksack over my shoulder and started up the track. The stream ran\\nalong the left side of the trail, and a forest of deciduous trees lined the\\nright. I had been climbing the gentle slope for some 15 minutes when I came to a road leading\\ninto the woods on the right, the opening barely wide enough to\\naccommodate a car. AMI HOSTEL PRIVATE NO TRESPASSING\\nread the sign by the road. Sharply etched tyre tracks ran up the road through the trees. The\\noccasional flapping of wings echoed in the woods. The sound came\\nthrough with strange clarity, as if amplified above the other voices of\\nthe forest. Once, from far away, I heard what might have been a rifle\\nshot, but it was a small and muffled sound, as though it had passed\\nthrough several filters. Beyond the woods I came to a white stone wall. It was no higher than\\nmy own height and, lacking additional barriers on top, would have\\nbeen easy for me to scale. The black iron gate looked sturdy enough,\\nbut it was wide open, and there was no one manning the guardhouse.\\nAnother sign like the last one stood by the gate: AMI HOSTEL PRIVATE NO TRESPASSING. A few clues suggested the guard had\\nbeen there until some moments before: the ashtray held three butt-\\nends, a tea cup stood there half empty, a transistor radio sat on a shelf,\\nand the clock on the wall ticked off the time with a dry sound. I waited\\na while for the person to come back, but when that showed no sign of\\nhappening, I gave a few pushes to something that looked as if it might\\nbe a bell. The area just inside the gate was a car park. In it stood a\\nmini-bus, a four-wheel drive Land Cruiser, and a dark blue Volvo.\\nThe car park could have held 30 cars, but only those three were parked\\nthere now. Two or three minutes went by, and then a gatekeeper in a navy-blue\\nuniform came down the forest road on a yellow bicycle. He was a tall\\nman in his early sixties with receding hair. He leaned the yellow bike\\nagainst the guardhouse and said, \"I\\'m very sorry to have kept you\\nwaiting,\" though he didn\\'t sound sorry at all. The number 32 was\\npainted in white on the bike\\'s mudguard. When I gave him my name,\\nhe picked up the phone and repeated it twice to someone on the other\\nend, replied \"Yes, uh-huh, I see\" to the other person, then hung up. \"Go to the main building, please, and ask for Doctor Ishida,\" he said\\nto me. \"You take this road through the trees to a roundabout. Then\\ntake your second left - got that? Your \\nsecond\\n left - from the\\nroundabout. You\\'ll see an old house. Turn right and go through\\nanother bunch of trees to a concrete building. That\\'s the main building.\\nIt\\'s easy, just watch for the signs.\" I took the second left from the roundabout as instructed, and where\\nthat path ended I came to an interesting old building that obviously\\nhad been someone\\'s country house once. It had a manicured garden\\nwith well-shaped rocks and a stone lantern. It must have been a\\ncountry estate. Turning right through the trees, I saw a three-storey\\nconcrete building. It stood in a hollowed-out area, and so there was\\nnothing overwhelming about its three storeys. It was simple in design\\nand gave a strong impression of cleanliness. The entrance was on the second floor. I climbed the stairs and went in\\nthrough a big glass door to find a young woman in a red dress at the\\nreception desk. I gave her my name and said I had been instructed to\\nask for Doctor Ishida. She smiled and gestured towards a brown sofa,\\nsuggesting in low tones that I wait there for the doctor to come. Then\\nshe dialled a number. I lowered my rucksack from my back, sank\\ndown into the deep cushions of the sofa, and surveyed the place. It\\nwas a clean, pleasant lobby, with ornamental potted plants, tasteful\\nabstract paintings, and a polished floor. As I waited, I kept my eyes on\\nthe floor\\'s reflection of my shoes. At one point the receptionist assured me, \"The doctor will be \\nhere\\nsoon.\" I nodded. What an incredibly quiet place! There were no\\nsounds of any kind. It was as though everyone were taking a siesta.\\nPeople, animals, insects, plants must all be sound asleep, I thought, it\\nwas such a quiet afternoon. Before long, though, I heard the soft padding of rubber soles, and a\\nmature, bristly-haired woman appeared. She swept across the lobby,\\nsat down next to me, crossed her legs and took my hand. Instead of\\njust shaking it, she turned my hand over, examining it front and back.\\n\"You haven\\'t played a musical instrument, at least not for some years\\nnow, have you?\" were the first words out of her mouth. \"No,\" I said, taken aback. \"You’re right.\" \"I can tell from your hands,\" she said with a smile. There was something almost mysterious about this woman. Her face\\nhad lots of wrinkles. These were the first thing to catch your eye, but\\nthey didn’t make her look old. Instead, they emphasized a certain\\nyouthfulness in her that transcended age. The wrinkles \\nbelonged\\nwhere they were, as if they had been part of her face since birth. When\\nshe smiled, the wrinkles smiled with her; when she frowned, the\\nwrinkles frowned, too. And when she was neither smiling nor frowning, the wrinkles lay scattered over her face in a strangely warm,\\nironic way. Here was a woman in her late thirties who seemed not merely a nice person but whose niceness drew you to her. I liked her\\nfrom the moment I saw her. Wildly chopped, her hair stuck out in patches and the fringe lay\\ncrooked against her forehead, but the style suited her perfectly. She\\nwore a blue work shirt over a white T-shirt, baggy, cream-coloured\\ncotton Uousers, and tennis shoes. Long and slim, she had almost no\\nbreasts. Her lips moved constantly to one side in a kind of ironic curl,\\nand the wrinkles at the comers of her eyes moved in tiny twitches. She\\nlooked like a kindly, skilled, but somewhat world-weary female\\ncarpenter. Chin drawn in and lips curled, she took some time to look me over\\nfrom head to toe. I imagined that any minute now she was going to\\nwhip out her tape measure and start measuring me everywhere. \"Can you play an instrument?\" she asked. \"Sorry, no,\" I said. \"Too bad,\" she said. \"It would have been fun.\" \"I suppose so,\" I said. Why all this talk about musical instruments? She took a pack of Seven Stars from her breast pocket, put one\\nbetween her lips, lit it with a lighter and began puffing away with\\nobvious pleasure. \"It crossed my mind that I should tell you about this place, Mr. -\\nWatanabe, wasn\\'t it? - before you see Naoko. So I arranged for the\\ntwo of us to have this little talk. Ami Hostel is kind of unusual - you\\nmight find it a little confusing without any background knowledge.\\nI\\'m right, aren\\'t I, in supposing that you don\\'t know anything about\\nthis place?\" \"Almost nothing.\" \"Well, then, first of all - \" she began, then snapped her fingers. \"Come\\nto think of it, have you had lunch? I\\'ll bet you\\'re hungry.\" \"You\\'re right, I am.\" \"Come with me, then. We can talk over food in the dining hall.\\nLunchtime is over, but if we go now they can still make us\\nsomething.\" She took the lead, hurrying down a corridor and a flight of stairs to the\\nfirst-floor dining hall. It was a large room, with enough space for\\nperhaps 200 people, but only half was in use, the other half partitioned\\noff, like a resort hotel out of season. The day\\'s menu listed a potato\\nstew with noodles, salad, orange juice and bread. The vegetables\\nturned out to be as delicious as Naoko had said in her letter, and I\\nfinished everything on my plate. \"You obviously enjoy your food!\" said my female companion. \"It\\'s wonderful,\" I said. \"Plus, I\\'ve hardly eaten anything all day.\" \"You\\'re welcome to mine if you like. I\\'m full. Here, go ahead.\" \"I will, if you really don’t want it.\" \"I\\'ve got a small stomach. It doesn\\'t hold much. I make up for what\\nI\\'m missing with cigarettes.\" She lit another Seven Star. \"Oh, by the\\nway, you can call me Reiko. Everybody does.\" Reiko seemed to derive great pleasure from watching me while I ate\\nthe potato stew she had hardly touched and munched on her bread. \"Are you Naoko\\'s doctor?\" I asked. \"Me?! Naoko\\'s doctor?!\" She screwed up her face. \"What makes you\\nthink I\\'m a doctor?\" \"They told me to ask for Doctor Ishida.\" \"Oh, I get it. No no no, I teach music here. It\\'s a kind of therapy for\\nsome patients, so for fun they call me \"The Music Doctor\\' and\\nsometimes \"Doctor Ishida\\'. But I\\'m just another patient. I\\'ve been here\\nseven years. I work as a music teacher and help out in the office, so\\nit\\'s hard to tell any more whether I\\'m a patient or staff. Didn’t Naoko\\ntell you about me?\" I shook my head. \"That\\'s strange,\" said Reiko. \"I\\'m Naoko\\'s room-mate. I like living\\nwith her. We talk about all kinds of things. Including you.\" \"What about me?\" \"Well, first I have to tell you about this place,\" said Reiko, ignoring my question. \"The first thing you ought to know is that this is no\\nordinary \"hospital\\'. It\\'s not so much for treatment as for\\nconvalescence. We do have a few doctors, of course, and they give\\nhourly sessions, but they\\'re just checking people\\'s conditions, taking\\ntheir temperature and things like that, not administering \"treatments\\'\\nas in an ordinary hospital. There are no bars on the windows here, and\\nthe gate is always wide open. People enter and leave voluntarily. You\\nhave to be suited to that kind of convalescence to be admitted here in\\nthe first place. In some cases, people who need specialized therapy\\nend up going to a specialized hospital. OK so far?\" \"I think so,\" I said. \"But what does this \"convalescence\\' consist of?\\nCan you give me a concrete example?\" Reiko exhaled a cloud of smoke and drank what was left of her orange\\njuice. \"Just living here is the convalescence,\" she said. A regular\\nroutine, exercise, isolation from the outside world, clean air, quiet.\\nOur farmland makes us practically self-sufficient; there\\'s no TV or\\nradio. We\\'re like one of those commune places you hear so much\\nabout. Of course, one thing different from a commune is that it costs a\\nbundle to get in here.\" A bundle?\" \"Well, it\\'s not ridiculously expensive, but it\\'s not cheap. Just look at\\nthese facilities. We\\'ve got a lot of land here, a few patients, a big staff,\\nand in my case I\\'ve been here a long time. True, I\\'m almost staff\\nmyself so I get concessions, but still ... Now, how about a cup of\\ncoffee?\" I said I’d like some. She stubbed out her cigarette and went over to the\\ncounter, where she poured two cups of coffee from a warm pot and\\nbrought them back to where we were sitting. She put sugar in hers,\\nstirred it, frowned, and took\\na sip. -You know,\" she said, \"this sanatorium is not a profitmaking\\nenterprise, so it can keep going without charging as much as it might have to otherwise. The land was a donation. They created a\\ncorporation for the purpose. The whole place used to be the donor\\'s\\nsummer home about 20 years ago. You saw the old house. I’m sure?\" I said I had. \"That used to be the only building on the property. It’s where they did\\ngroup therapy. That’s how it all got started. The donor\\'s son had a\\ntendency towards mental illness and a specialist recommended group\\ntherapy for him. The doctor\\'s theory was that if you could have a\\ngroup of patients living out in the country, helping each other with\\nphysical labour and have a doctor for advice and check-ups, you could\\ncure certain kinds of sickness. They tried it, and the operation grew\\nand was incorporated, and they put more land under cultivation, and\\nput up the main building five years ago.\" \"Meaning, the therapy worked.\" \"Well, not for everything. Lots of people don\\'t get better. But also a\\nlot of people who couldn\\'t be helped anywhere else managed a\\ncomplete recovery here. The best thing about this place is the way\\neverybody helps everybody else. Everybody knows they\\'re flawed in\\nsome way, and so they try to help each other. Other places don\\'t work\\nthat way, unfortunately. Doctors are doctors and patients are patients:\\nthe patient looks for help to the doctor and the doctor gives his help to\\nthe patient. Here, though, we all help each other. We\\'re all each other\\'s\\nmirrors, and the doctors are part of us. They watch us from the\\nsidelines and they slip in to help us if they see we need something, but\\nit sometimes happens that we help them. Sometimes we\\'re better at\\nsomething than they are. For example, I\\'m teaching one doctor to play\\nthe piano and another patient is teaching a nurse French. That kind of\\nthing. Patients with problems like ours are often blessed with special\\nabilities. So everyone here is equal - patients, staff - and you. You\\'re\\none of us while you\\'re in here, so I help you and you help me.\" Reiko\\nsmiled, gently flexing every wrinkle on her face. \"You help Naoko\\nand Naoko helps you.\" \"What should I do, then? Give me an example.\" \"First you decide that you want to help and that you need to be helped\\nby the other person. Then you are totally honest. You will not lie, you\\nwill not gloss over anything, you will not cover up anything that might\\nprove embarrassing to you. That\\'s all there is to it.\" \"I\\'ll try,\" I said. \"But tell me, Reiko, why have you been in here for\\nseven years? Talking with you like this, I can\\'t believe there\\'s anything\\nwrong with you.\" \"Not while the sun\\'s up,\" she said with a sombre look. \"But when\\nnight comes, I start drooling and rolling on the floor.\" \"Really?\" \"Don\\'t be ridiculous. I\\'m kidding,\" she said, shaking her head with a\\nlook of disgust. \"I\\'m completely well - for now, at least. I stay here\\nbecause I enjoy helping other people get well, teaching music,\\ngrowing vegetables. I like it here. We\\'re all more or less friends.\\nCompared to that, what have I got in the outside world? I\\'m 38, going\\non 40. I\\'m not like Naoko. There\\'s nobody waiting for me to get out,\\nno family to take me back. I don’t have any work to speak of, and\\nalmost no friends. And after seven years, I don\\'t know what\\'s going on\\nout there. Oh, I\\'ll read a paper in the library every once in a while, but\\nI haven\\'t set foot outside this property all that time. I wouldn’t know\\nwhat to do if I left.\" \"But maybe a new world would open up for you,\" I said. \"It’s worth a\\ntry, don’t you think?\" \"Hmm, you may be right,\" she said, turning her cigarette lighter over\\nand over in her hand. \"But I’ve got my own set of problems. lean tell\\nyou all about them sometime if you like.\" I nodded in response. \"And Naoko,\" I said, \"is she any better?\" \"Hmm, we think so. She was pretty confused at first and we had our\\ndoubts for a while, but she’s calmed down now and improved to the\\npoint where she’s able to express herself verbally. She’s definitely\\nheading in the right direction. But she should have received treatment\\na lot earlier. Her symptoms were already apparent from the time that boyfriend of hers, Kizuki, killed himself. Her family should have seen\\nit, and she herself should have realized that something was wrong. Of\\ncourse, things weren\\'t right at home, either ...\" \"They weren\\'t?\" I shot back. \"You didn’t know?\" Reiko seemed more surprised than I was. I shook my head. \"I’d better let Naoko tell you about that herself. She\\'s ready for some\\nhonest talk with you.\" Reiko gave her coffee another stir and took a\\nsip. \"There\\'s one more thing you need to know,\" she said. \"According\\nto the rules here, you and Naoko will not be allowed to be done\\ntogether. Visitors can\\'t be alone with patients. An observer always has\\nto be present - which in this case means me. I\\'m sorry, but you\\'ll just\\nhave to put up with me. OK?\" \"OK,\" I said with a smile. \"But still,\" she said, \"the two of you can talk about anything you’d\\nlike. Forget I\\'m there. I know pretty much everything there is to know\\nabout you and Naoko.\" \"Everything?\" \"Pretty much. We have these group sessions, you know. So we learn a\\nlot about each other. Plus Naoko and I talk about everything. We don\\'t\\nhave many secrets here.\" I looked at Reiko as I drank my coffee. \"To tell you the truth,\" I said,\\n\"I\\'m confused. I still don’t know whether what I did to Naoko in\\nTokyo was the right thing to do or not. I\\'ve been thinking about it this\\nwhole time, but I still don’t know.\" \"And neither do I,\" said Reiko. \"And neither does Naoko. That\\'s\\nsomething the two of you will have to decide for yourselves. See what\\nI mean? Whatever happened, the two of you can turn it in the right\\ndirection - \\nif\\n you can reach some kind of mutual understanding.\\nMaybe, once you\\'ve got \\nthat\\n taken care of, you can go back and think\\nabout whether what happened was the right thing or not. What do you\\nsay?\" I nodded. \"I think the three of us can help each other - you and Naoko and I - if\\nwe really want to, and if we\\'re really honest. It can be incredibly\\neffective when three people work at it like that. How long can you\\nstay?\" \"Well, I\\'d like to get back to Tokyo by early evening the day after\\ntomorrow. I have to work, and I\\'ve got a German exam on Thursday.\"\\n\"Good,\" she said. \"So you can stay with us. That way it won\\'t cost you\\nanything and you can talk without having to worry about the time.\"\\n\"With \"us\\'?\" I asked. \"Naoko and me, of course,\" said Reiko. \"We have a separate bedroom,\\nand there\\'s a sofa bed in the living room, so you\\'ll be able to sleep\\nfine. Don\\'t worry.\" ,,Do they allow that?\" I asked. \"Can a male visitor stay in a Woman\\'s\\nroom?\" \"I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to come in and rape us in the middle of\\nthe night?\" \"Don’t be silly.\" \"So there\\'s no problem, then. Stay in our place and we can have some\\nnice, long talks. That would be the best thing. Then we can really\\nunderstand each other. And I can play my guitar for you. I\\'m pretty\\ngood, you know.\" \"Are you sure I\\'m not going to be in the way?\" Reiko put her third Seven Star between her lips and lit it after\\nscrewing up the corner of her mouth. \"Naoko and I have already discussed this. The two of us together are\\ngiving you a personal invitation to stay with us. Don’t you think you\\nshould just politely accept?\" \"Of course. I\\'ll be glad to.\" Reiko deepened the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes and looked at\\nme for a time. \"You\\'ve got this funny way of talking,\" she said. \"Don’t\\ntell me you\\'re trying to imitate that boy in \\nCatcher in the Rye?\" \"No way!\" I said with a smile. Reiko smiled too, cigarette in mouth. \"You \\nare\\n a good person, though.\\nI can tell that much from looking at you. I can tell these things after\\nseven years of watching people come and go here: there are people\\nwho can open their hearts and people who can\\'t. You\\'re one of the\\nones who can. Or, more precisely, you can if you want to.\" \"What happens when people open their hearts?\" Reiko clasped her hands together on the table, cigarette dangling from\\nher lips. She was enjoying this. \"They get better,\" she said. Ash\\ndropped onto the table, but she seemed not to notice. Reiko and I left the main building, crossed a hill, and passed by a\\npool, some tennis courts, and a basketball court. Two men - one thin\\nand middle-aged, the other young and fat were on a tennis court. Both\\nused their racquets well, but to me the game they were playing could\\nnot have been tennis. It seemed as if the two of them had a special\\ninterest in the bounce of tennis balls and were doing research in that\\narea. They slammed the ball back and forth with a kind of strange\\nconcentration. Both were drenched in sweat. The young man, in the\\nend of the court closer to us, noticed Reiko and came over. They\\nexchanged a few words, smiling. Near the court, a man with no\\nexpression on his face was using a large mower to cut the grass.\\nMoving on, we came to a patch of woods where some 15 or 20 neat\\nlittle cottages stood at some distance from each other. The same kind\\nof yellow bike the gatekeeper had been riding was parked at the\\nentrance to almost every house. \"Staff members and their families live\\nhere,\" said Reiko. \"We have just about everything we need without going to the city,\"\\nshe said as we walked along. \"Where food is concerned, as I said\\nbefore, we\\'re practically self-sufficient. We get eggs from our own\\nchicken coop. We have books and records and exercise facilities, our\\nown convenience store, and every week barbers and beauticians come\\nto visit. We even have films at weekends. Anything special we need we can ask a staff member to buy for us in town. Clothing we order\\nfrom catalogues. Living here is no problem.\" \"But you can\\'t go into town?\" \"No, that we can\\'t do. Of course if there\\'s something special, like we\\nhave to go to the dentist or something, that’s another matter, but as a\\nrule we can’t go into town. Each person is completely free to leave this\\nplace, but once you\\'ve left you can\\'t come back. You burn your\\nbridges. You can\\'t go off for a couple of days in town and expect to\\ncome back. It only stands to reason, though. Everybody would be\\ncoming and going.\" Beyond the trees we came to a gentle slope along which, at irregular\\nintervals, was a row of two-storey wooden houses that had something\\nodd about them. What made them look strange it\\'s hard to say, but that\\nwas the first thing I felt when I saw them. My reaction was a lot like\\nwhat we feel when we see unreality painted in a pleasant way. It\\noccurred to me that this was what you might get if Walt Disney did an\\nanimated version of a Munch painting. All the houses were exactly the\\nsame shape and colour, nearly cubical, in perfect left-to-right\\nsymmetry, with big front doors and lots of windows. The road twisted\\nits way among them like the artificial practice course of a driving\\nschool. There was a well-manicured flowering shrubbery in front of\\nevery house. The place was deserted, and curtains covered all the\\nwindows. \"This is called Area C. The women live here. Us! There are ten\\nhouses, each containing four units, two people per unit. That\\'s 80\\npeople all together, but at the moment there are only 32 of us.\" \"Quiet, isn\\'t it?\" \"Well, there\\'s nobody here now,\" Reiko said. \"I\\'ve been given special\\npermission to move around freely like this, but everyone else is off\\npursuing their individual schedules. Some are exercising, some are\\ngardening, some are in group therapy, some are out gathering wild\\nplants. Each person makes up his or her own schedule. Let\\'s see. what\\'s Naoko doing now? I think she was supposed to be working on\\nnew paint and wallpaper. I forget. There are a few jobs like that that\\ndon\\'t finish till five.\" Reiko walked into the building marked \"C-7\", climbed the stairs at the\\nfar end of the hallway, and opened the door on the right, which was\\nunlocked. She showed me around the flat, a pleasant, if plain, four-\\nroom unit: living room, bedroom, kitchen, and bath. It had no extra\\nfurniture or unnecessary decoration, but neither was the place severe.\\nThere was nothing special about it, but being there was kind of like\\nbeing with Reiko: you could relax and let the tension leave your body.\\nThe living room had a sofa, a table, and a rocking chair. Another table\\nstood in the kitchen. Both tables had large ashtrays on them. The\\nbedroom had two beds, two desks and a closet. A small night table\\nstood between the beds with a reading lamp on top and a paperback\\nturned face down. The kitchen had a small electric cooker that\\nmatched the fridge and was equipped for simple cooking. \"No bath, just a shower, but it\\'s pretty impressive, wouldn\\'t you say?\\nBath and laundry facilities are communal.\" \"It’s almost too impressive. My dorm room has a ceiling and a\\nwindow.\" \"Ah, but you haven\\'t seen the winters here,\" said Reiko, touching my\\nback to guide me to the sofa and sitting down next to me. \"They\\'re\\nlong and harsh. Nothing but snow and snow and more snow\\neverywhere you look. It gets damp and chills you to the bone. We\\nspend the winter shovelling snow. Mostly you stay inside where it\\'s\\nwarm and listen to music or talk or knit. If you didn\\'t have this much\\nspace, you’d suffocate. You\\'ll see if you come here in the winter.\" Reiko gave a deep sigh as if picturing wintertime, then folded her\\nhands on her knees. \"This will be your bed,\" she said, patting the sofa. \"We\\'ll sleep in the bedroom, and you\\'ll sleep here. You should be all right, don\\'t you think?\" \"I\\'m sure I\\'ll be fine.\" \"So, that settles it,\" said Reiko. \"We\\'ll be back around five. Naoko and\\nI both have things to do until then. Do you mind staying here alone?\"\\n\"Not at all. I\\'ll study my German.\" When Reiko left, I stretched out on the sofa and closed my eyes. I lay\\nthere steeping myself in the silence when, out of nowhere, I thought of\\nthe time Kizuki and I went on a motorbike ride. That had been\\nautumn, too, I realized. Autumn how many years ago? Yes, four. I\\nrecalled the smell of Kizuki\\'s leather jacket and the racket made by\\nthat red Yamaha 125cc bike. We went to a spot far down the coast,\\nand came back the same evening, exhausted. Nothing special\\nhappened on the way, but I remembered it well. The sharp autumn\\nwind moaned in my ears, and looking up at the sky, my hands\\nclutching Kizuki\\'s jacket, I felt as if I might be swept into outer space. I lay there for a long time, letting my mind wander from one memory\\nto another. For some strange reason, lying in this room seemed to\\nbring back old memories that I had rarely if ever recalled before.\\nSome of them were pleasant, but others carried a trace of sadness. How long did this go on? I was so immersed in that torrent of memory\\n(and it was a torrent, like a spring gushing out of the rocks) that I\\nfailed to notice Naoko quietly open the door and come in. I opened my\\neyes, and there she was. I raised my head and looked into her eyes for\\na time. She was sitting on the arm of the sofa, looking at me. At first I\\nthought she might be an image spun into existence \\nby my\\n own\\nmemories. But it was the real Naoko. \"Sleeping?\" she whispered. \"No,\" I said, \"just thinking.\" I sat up and asked, \"How are you?\" \"I\\'m good,\" she said with a little smile like a pale, distant scene. \"I\\ndon\\'t have much time, though. I\\'m not supposed to be here now. I just\\ngot away for a minute, and I have to go back right away. Don’t you\\nhate my hair?\" \"Not at all,\" I said. \"It\\'s cute.\" Her hair was in a simple schoolgirl style, with one side held in place with a hairslide the way she used to\\nhave it in the old days. It suited her very well, as if she had always\\nworn it that way. She looked like one of the beautiful little girls you\\nsee in woodblock prints from the Middle Ages. \"It\\'s such a pain, I have Reiko cut it for me. Do you really think it\\'s\\ncute?\" \"Really.\" \"My mother hates it.\" She opened the hairslide, let the hair hang\\ndown, smoothed it with her fingers, and closed the hairslide again. It\\nwas shaped like a butterfly. \"I wanted to see you alone before the three of us get together. Not that\\nI had anything special to say. I just wanted to see your face and get\\nused to having you here. Otherwise, I\\'d have trouble getting to know\\nyou again. I\\'m so bad with people.\" \"Well?\" I asked. \"Is it working?\" \"A little,\" she said, touching her hairslide again. \"But time\\'s up. I\\'ve\\ngot to go.\" I nodded. \"Torn,\" she began, \"I really want to thank you for coming to see me. It\\nmakes me very happy. But if being here is any kind of burden to you,\\nyou shouldn’t hesitate to tell me so. This is a special place, and it has a\\nspecial system, and some people can\\'t get into it. So if you feel like\\nthat, please be honest and let me know. I won\\'t be crushed. We\\'re\\nhonest with each other here. We tell each other all kinds of things with\\ncomplete honesty.\" \"I\\'ll tell you,\" I said. \"I\\'ll be honest.\" Naoko sat down and leaned against me on the sofa. When I put my\\narm around her, she rested her head on my shoulder and pressed her\\nface to my neck. She stayed like that for a time, almost as if she were\\ntaking my temperature. Holding her, I felt warm in the chest. After a\\nshort while, she stood up without saying a word and went out through\\nthe door as quietly as she had come in. With Naoko gone, I went to sleep on the sofa. I hadn\\'t intended to do\\nso, but I fell into the kind of deep sleep I had not had for a long time,\\nfilled with a sense of Naoko\\'s presence. In the kitchen were the dishes\\nNaoko used, in the bathroom was the toothbrush Naoko used, and in\\nthe bedroom was the bed in which Naoko slept. Sleeping soundly in\\nthis flat of hers, I wrung the fatigue from every cell of my body, drop\\nby drop. I dreamed of a butterfly dancing in the half-light. When I awoke again, the hands of my watch were pointing to 4.35.\\nThe light had changed, the wind had died, the shapes of the clouds\\nwere different. I had sweated in my sleep, so I dried my face with a\\nsmall towel from my rucksack and put on a fresh vest. Going to the\\nkitchen, I drank some water and stood there looking through the\\nwindow over the sink. I was facing a window in the building opposite,\\non the inside of which hung several paper cut-outs - a bird, a cloud, a\\ncow, a cat, all in skilful silhouette and joined together. As before,\\nthere was no sign of anyone about, and there were no sounds of any\\nkind. I felt as if I were living alone in an extremely well-cared-for\\nruin. People started coming back to Area C a little after five Looking out of\\nthe kitchen window, I saw three women passing below. All wore hats\\nthat prevented me from telling their ages, but judging from their\\nvoices, they were not very young. Shortly after they had disappeared\\naround a corner, four more women appeared from the same direction\\nand, like the first group, disappeared around the same corner. An\\nevening mood hung over everything. From the living room window I\\ncould see trees and a line of hills. Above the ridge floated a border of\\npale sunlight. Naoko and Reiko came back together at 5.30. Naoko and I exchanged\\nproper greetings as if meeting for the first time. She seemed truly\\nembarrassed. Reiko noticed the book I had been reading and asked\\nwhat it was. Thomas Mann\\'s \\nThe Magic Mountain,\\n I told her. \"How could you bring a book like that to a place like this?\" she demanded. She was right, of course. Reiko then made coffee for the three of us. I told Naoko about Storm\\nTrooper\\'s sudden disappearance and about the last day I saw him,\\nwhen he gave me the firefly. \"I\\'m so sorry he\\'s gone,\" she said. \"I wanted to hear more stories about\\nhim.\" Reiko asked who Storm Trooper was, so I told her about his\\nantics and got a big laugh from her. The world was at peace and filled\\nwith laughter as long as Storm Trooper stories were being told. At six we went to the dining hall in the main building for supper.\\nNaoko and I had fried fish with green salad, boiled vegetables, rice\\nand miso soup. Reiko limited herself to pasta salad and coffee,\\nfollowed by another cigarette. \"You don\\'t need to eat so much as you get older,\" she said by way of\\nexplanation. Some 20 other people were there in the dining hall. A few newcomers\\narrived as we ate, meanwhile some others left. Aside from the variety\\nin people\\'s ages, the scene looked pretty much like that of the dining\\nhall in my dormitory. Where it differed was the uniform volume at\\nwhich people conversed. There were no loud voices and no whispers,\\nno one laughing out loud or crying out in shock, no one yelling with\\nexaggerated gestures, nothing but quiet conversations, all carrying on\\nat the same level. People were eating in groups of three to five, each\\nwith a single speaker, to whom the others would listen with nods and\\ngrunts of interest, and when that person had finished speaking, the\\nnext would take up the conversation. I could not tell what they were\\nsaying, but the way they said it reminded me of the strange tennis\\ngame I had seen at noon. I wondered if Naoko spoke like this when\\nshe was with them and. strangely enough, I felt a twinge of loneliness\\nmixed with jealousy. At the table behind me, a balding man in white with the authentic air\\nof a doctor was holding forth to a nervouslooking young man in\\nglasses and a squirrel-faced woman of middle age on the effects of weightlessness on the secretion of gastric juices. The two listened with\\nan occasional \"My goodness\" or \"Really?\" but the longer I listened to\\nthe balding man\\'s style of speaking, the less certain I became that,\\neven in his white coat, he was really a doctor. No one in the dining hall paid me any special attention. No one stared\\nor even seemed to notice I was there. My presence must have been an\\nentirely natural event. Just once, though, the man in white spun around and asked me, \"How\\nlong will you be staying?\" \"Two nights,\" I said. \"I\\'ll be leaving on Wednesday.\" \"It\\'s nice here this time of year, isn\\'t it? But come again in winter. It\\'s\\nreally\\n nice when everything\\'s white.\" \"Naoko may be out of here by the time it snows,\" said Reiko to the\\nman. \"True, but still, the winter\\'s really nice,\" he repeated with a sombre\\nexpression. I felt increasingly unsure as to whether or not he was a\\ndoctor. \"What do you people talk about?\" I asked Reiko, who seemed to not\\nquite follow me. \"What do we talk about? Just ordinary things. What happened that\\nday, or books we\\'ve read, or tomorrow\\'s weather, you know. Don\\'t tell\\nme you\\'re wondering if people jump to their feet and shout stuff like:\\n\"It\\'ll rain tomorrow if a polar bear eats the stars tonight!\"\\' \"No, no, of course not,\" I said. \"I was just wondering what all these\\nquiet conversations were about.\" \"It\\'s a quiet place, so people talk quietly,\" said Naoko. She made a\\nneat pile of fish bones at the edge of her plate and dabbed at her\\nmouth with a handkerchief. \"There\\'s no need to raise your voice here.\\nYou don\\'t have to convince anybody of anything, and you don\\'t have\\nto attract anyone\\'s attention.\" \"I guess not,\" I said, but as I ate my meal in those quiet surroundings,\\nI was surprised to find myself missing the hum of people. I wanted to hear laughter and people shouting for no reason and saying overblown\\nthings. That was just the kind of noise I had become weary of in\\nrecent months, but sitting here eating fish in this unnaturally quiet\\nroom, I couldn\\'t relax. The dining hall had all the atmosphere of a\\nspecialized -machine-tool trade fair. People with a strong interest in a\\nspecialist field came together in a specific place and exchanged\\ninformation understood only by themselves. Back in the room after supper, Naoko and Reiko announced that they\\nwould be going to the Area C communal bath and that if I didn\\'t mind\\nhaving just a shower, I could use the one in their bathroom. I would do\\nthat, I said, and after they were gone I undressed, showered, and\\nwashed my hair. I found a Bill Evans album in the bookcase and was\\nlistening to it while drying my hair when I realized that it was the\\nrecord I had played in Naoko’s room on the night of her birthday, the\\nnight she cried and I took her in my arms. That had been \\nonly\\n six\\nmonths ago, but it felt like something from a much remoter past.\\nMaybe it felt that way because I had thought about it so often - too\\noften, to the point where it had distorted my sense of time. The moon was so bright, I turned the lights off and stretched out on\\nthe sofa to listen to Bill Evans’ piano. Streaming in through the\\nwindow, the moonlight cast long shadows and splashed the walls with\\na touch of diluted Indian ink. I took a thin metal flask from my\\nrucksack, let my mouth fill with the brandy it contained, allowed the\\nwarmth to move slowly down my throat to my stomach, and from\\nthere felt it spreading to every extremity. After a final sip, I closed the\\nflask and returned it to my rucksack. Now the moonlight seemed to be\\nswaying with the music. Twenty minutes later, Naoko and Reiko came back from the bath. \"Oh! It was so dark here, we thought you had packed your bags and\\ngone back to Tokyo!\" exclaimed Reiko. \"No way,\" I said. \"I hadn\\'t seen such a bright moon for years. I wanted\\nto look at it with the lights off.\" \"It\\'s lovely, though,\" said Naoko. \"Reiko, do we still have those\\ncandles from the last power cut?\" \"Probably, in a kitchen drawer.\" Naoko brought a large, white candle from the kitchen. I lit it, dripped\\na little wax into a plate, and stood it up. Reiko used the flame to light a\\ncigarette. As the three of us sat facing the candle amid these hushed\\nsurroundings, it began to seem as if we were the only ones left on\\nsome far edge of the world. The still shadows of the moonlight and the\\nswaying shadows of the candlelight met and melded on the white\\nwalls of the flat. Naoko and I sat next to each other on the sofa, and\\nReiko settled into the rocking chair facing us. \"How about some wine?\" Reiko asked me. \"You\\'re allowed to drink?\" I asked with some surprise. \"Well, not really,\" said Reiko, scratching an earlobe with a hint of\\nembarrassment. \"But they pretty much let it go. If it\\'s just wine or beer\\nand you don\\'t drink too much. I\\'ve got a friend on the staff who buys\\nme a little now and then.\" \"We have our drinking parties,\" said Naoko with a mischievous air.\\n\"Just the two of us.\" \"That\\'s nice,\" I said. Reiko took a bottle of white wine from the fridge, opened it with a\\ncorkscrew and brought three glasses. The wine had a clear, delicious\\nflavour that seemed almost homemade. When the record ended, Reiko\\nbrought out a guitar from under her bed, and after tuning it with a look\\nof fondness for the instrument, she began to play a slow Bach fugue.\\nShe missed her fingering every now and then, but it was real Bach,\\nwith real feeling - warm, intimate, and filled with the joy of\\nperformance. \"I started playing the guitar here,\" said Reiko. \"There are no pianos in\\nthe rooms, of course. I\\'m self-taught, and I don\\'t have guitar hands, so I\\'ll never get very good, but I really love the instrument. It\\'s small and\\nsimple and easy, kind of like a warm, little room.\" She played one more short Bach piece, something from a suite. Eyes\\non the candle flame, sipping wine, listening to Reiko\\'s Bach, I felt the\\ntension inside me slipping away. When Reiko ended the Bach, Naoko\\nasked her to play a Beatles song. \"Request time,\" said Reiko, winking at me. \"She makes me play\\nBeatles every day, like I\\'m her music slave.\" Despite her protest, Reiko played a fine \"Michelle\". \"That\\'s a good one,\" she said. \"I really like that song.\" She took a sip\\nof wine and puffed her cigarette. \"It makes me feel like I\\'m in a big\\nmeadow in a soft rain.\" Then she played \"Nowhere Man\" and \"Julia\". Now and then as she\\nplayed, she would close her eyes and shake her head. Afterwards she\\nwould return to the wine and the cigarette. \"Play \"Norwegian Wood\\',\" said Naoko. Reiko brought a porcelain beckoning cat from the kitchen. It was a\\ncoin bank, and Naoko dropped a ? 100 piece from her purse into its\\nslot. \"What\\'s this all about?\" I asked. \"It\\'s a rule,\" said Naoko. \"When I request \"Norwegian Wood,\\' I have\\nto put ? 100 into the bank. It\\'s my favourite, so I make a point of\\npaying for it. I make a request when I really want to hear it.\" \"And that way I get my cigarette money!\" said Reiko. Reiko gave her fingers a good flexing and then played \"Norwegian\\nWood\". Again she played with real feeling, but never allowed it to\\nbecome sentimental. I took ? 100 coin from my pocket and dropped it\\ninto the bank. \"Thank you,\" said Reiko with a sweet smile. \"That song can make me feel so sad,\" said Naoko. \"I don\\'t know, I\\nguess I imagine myself wandering in a deep wood. I\\'m all alone and\\nit\\'s cold and dark, and nobody comes to save me. That\\'s why Reiko never plays it unless I request it. Sounds like Casablanca!\" Reiko said with a laugh. She followed \"Norwegian Wood\" with a few bossa novas while I kept\\nmy eyes on Naoko. As she had said in her letter, she looked healthier\\nthan before, suntanned, her body firm from exercise and outdoor\\nwork. Her eyes were the same deep clear pools they had always been,\\nand her small lips still trembled shyly, but overall her beauty had\\nbegun to change to that of a mature woman. Almost gone now was the\\nsharp edge - the chilling sharpness of a thin blade - that could be\\nglimpsed in the shadows of her beauty, in place of which there now\\nhovered a uniquely soothing, quiet calm. I felt moved by this new,\\ngentle beauty of hers, and amazed to think that a woman could change\\nso much in the course of half a year. I felt as drawn to her as ever,\\nperhaps more than before, but the thought of what she had lost in the\\nmeantime also gave me cause for regret. Never again would she have\\nthat self-centred beauty that seems to take its own, independent course\\nin adolescent girls and no one else. Naoko said she wanted to hear about how I was spending my days. I\\ntalked about the student strike and Nagasawa. This was the first time I\\nhad ever said anything about him to her. I found it challenging to give\\nher an accurate account of his odd humanity, his unique philosophy,\\nand his uncentred morality, but Naoko seemed finally to grasp what I\\nwas trying to tell her. I hid the fact that I went out hunting girls with\\nhim, revealing only that the one person in the dorm I spent any real\\ntime with was this unusual guy. All the while, Reiko went through\\nanother practice of the Bach fugue she had played before, taking\\noccasional breaks for wine and cigarettes. \"He sounds like a strange person,\" said Naoko. \"He is strange,\" I\\nsaid. \"But you like him?\" \"I\\'m not sure,\" I said. \"I guess I can\\'t say I like him. Nagasawa is\\nbeyond liking or not liking. He doesn\\'t try to be liked. In that sense,\\nhe’s a very honest guy, stoic even. He doesn\\'t try to fool anybody.\"\\n\"\"Stoic\\' sleeping with all those girls? Now that is weird,\" said Naoko, laughing. \"How many girls has he slept with?\" \"It\\'s probably up to 80 now,\" I said. \"But in his case, the higher the\\nnumbers go, the less each individual act seems to mean. Which is\\nwhat I think he\\'s trying to accomplish.\" \"And you call that \"stoic\\'?\" \"For him it is.\" Naoko thought about my words for a minute. \"I think he\\'s a lot sicker\\nin the head than I am,\" she said. \"So do I,\" I said. \"But he can put all of his warped qualities into a\\nlogical system. He\\'s brilliant. If you brought him here, he\\'d be out in\\ntwo days. \"Oh, sure, I know all that,\\' he\\'d say. \"I understand\\neverything you\\'re doing here.\\' He’s that kind of guy. The kind people\\nrespect.\" \"I guess I\\'m the opposite of brilliant,\" said Naoko. \"I don’t understand\\nanything they\\'re doing here - any better than I understand myself.\" \"It\\'s not because you\\'re not smart,\" I said. \"You\\'re normal. I\\'ve got\\ntons of things I don\\'t understand about myself. We\\'re both normal:\\nordinary.\" Naoko raised her feet to the edge of the sofa and rested her chin on\\nher knees. \"I want to know more about you,\" she said. \"I\\'m just an ordinary guy - ordinary family, ordinary education,\\nordinary face, ordinary exam results, ordinary thoughts in my head.\"\\n\"You\\'re such a big Scott Fitzgerald fan ... wasn\\'t he the one who said\\nyou shouldn’t trust anybody who calls himself an ordinary man? You\\nlent me the book!\" said Naoko with a mischievous smile. \"True,\" I said. \"But this is no affectation. I really, truly believe deep\\ndown that I\\'m an ordinary person. Can you find something in me that\\'s\\nnot\\n ordinary?\" \"Of course I can!\" said Naoko with a hint of impatience. \"Don’t you\\nget it ? Why do you think I slept with you? Because I was so drunk I\\nwould have slept with anyone?\" \"No, of course I don\\'t think that,\" I said. Naoko remained silent for a long time, staring at her toes. At a loss for\\nwords, I took another sip of wine. \"How many girls have you slept with, Toru?\" Naoko asked in a tiny\\nvoice as if the thought had just crossed her mind. \"Eight or nine,\" I answered truthfully. Reiko plopped the guitar into her lap. \"You\\'re not even 20 years old!\"\\nshe said. \"What kind of life are you leading?\" Naoko kept silent and watched me with those clear eyes of hers. I told\\nReiko about the first girl I\\'d slept with and how we had broken up. I\\nhad found it impossible to love her, I explained. I went on to tell her\\nabout my sleeping with one girl after another under Nagasawa\\'s\\ntutelage. \"I\\'m not trying to make excuses, but I was in pain,\" I said to Naoko.\\n\"Here I was, seeing you almost every week, and talking with you, and\\nknowing that the only one in your heart was Kizuki. It hurt. It really\\nhint. And I think that\\'s why I slept with girls I didn\\'t know.\" Naoko shook her head for a few moments, and then she raised her face\\nto look at me. \"You asked me that time why I had never slept with\\nKizuki, didn\\'t you? Do you still want to know?\" \"I suppose it’s something I really ought to know,\" I said. \"I think so, too,\" said Naoko. \"The dead will always be dead, but we\\nhave to go on living.\" I nodded. Reiko played the same difficult passage over and over,\\ntrying to get it right. \"I was ready to sleep with him,\" said Naoko, unclasping her hairslide\\nand letting ter hair down. She toyed with the butterfly shape in her\\nhands. \"And of course he wanted to sleep with me. So we tried. We\\ntried a lot. But it never worked. We couldn\\'t do it. I didn’t know why\\nthen, and I still don’t know why. I loved him, and I wasn\\'t worried\\nabout losing my virginity. I would have been glad to do anything he\\nwanted. But it never worked.\" Naoko lifted the hair she had let down and fastened it with the slide. \"I couldn’t get wet,\" she said in a tiny voice. \"I never opened to him.\\nSo it always hurt. I was just too dry, it hurt too much. We tried\\neverything we could think of - creams and things - but still it hurt me.\\nSo I used my fingers, or my lips. I would always do it for him that\\nway. You know what I mean.\" I nodded in silence. Naoko cast her gaze through the window at the moon, which looked\\nbigger and brighter now than it had before. \"I never wanted to talk\\nabout any of this,\" she said. \"I wanted to shut it up in my heart. I wish\\nI still could. But I have to talk about it. I don’t know the answer. I\\nmean, I was plenty wet the time I slept with you, wasn\\'t I?\" \"Uh-huh,\" I said. \"I was wet from the minute you walked into my flat the night of my\\ntwentieth birthday. I wanted you to hold me. I wanted you to take off\\nmy clothes, to touch me all over and enter me. I had never felt like\\nthat before. Why is that? Why do things happen like that? I mean, I\\nreally loved him.\" \"And not me,\" I said. \"You want to know why you felt that way about\\nme, even though you didn’t love me?\" \"I\\'m sorry,\" said Naoko. \"I don\\'t mean to hurt you, but this much you\\nhave to understand: Kizuki and I had a truly special relationship. We\\nhad been together from the time we were three. It\\'s how we grew up:\\nalways together, always talking, understanding each other perfectly.\\nThe first time we kissed it was in the first year of junior school - was\\njust wonderful. The first time I had my period, I ran to him and cried\\nlike a baby. We were that close. So after he died, I didn\\'t know how to\\nrelate to other people. I didn\\'t know what it meant to love another\\nperson.\" She reached for her wineglass on the table but only managed to knock\\nit over, spilling wine on the carpet. I crouched down and retrieved the\\nglass, setting it on the table. Did she want to drink some more? I\\nasked. Naoko remained silent for a while, then suddenly burst into tears, trembling all over. Slumping forward, she buried her face in her\\nhands and sobbed with the same suffocating violence as she had that\\nnight with me. Reiko laid down her guitar and sat by Naoko, caressing\\nher back. When she put an arm across Naoko\\'s shoulders, she pressed\\nher face against Reiko\\'s chest like a baby. \"You know,\" Reiko said to me, \"it might be a good idea for you to go\\nout for a little walk. Maybe 20 minutes. Sorry, but I think that would\\nhelp.\" I nodded and stood, pulling a jumper on over my shirt. \"Thanks for\\nstepping in,\" I said to Reiko. \"Don\\'t mention it,\" she said with a wink. \"This is not your fault. Don’t\\nworry, by the time you come back she\\'ll be OK.\" My feet carried me down the road, which was illuminated by the\\noddly unreal light of the moon, and into the woods. Beneath that moonlight, all sounds bore a strange reverberation. The\\nhollow sound of my own footsteps seemed to come from another\\ndirection as though I were hearing someone walking on the bottom of\\nthe sea. Behind me, every now and \\nthen,\\n I would hear a crack or a\\nrustle. A heavy pall hung over the forest, as if the animals of the night\\nwere holding their breath, waiting for me to pass. Where the road sloped upwards beyond the trees, I sat and looked\\ntowards the building where Naoko lived. It was easy to tell her room.\\nAll I had to do was find the one window towards the back where a\\nfaint light trembled. I focused on that point of light for a long, long\\ntime. It made me think of something like the final pulse of a soul\\'s\\ndying embers. I wanted to cup my hands over what was left and keep\\nit alive. I went on watching it the way Jay Gatsby watched that tiny\\nlight on the opposite shore night after night. When I walked back to the front entrance of the building half an hour\\nlater, I could hear Reiko practising the guitar. I padded up the stairs\\nand tapped on the door to the flat. Inside there was no sign of Naoko. Reiko sat alone on the carpet, playing her guitar. She pointed towards\\nthe bedroom door to let me know Naoko was in there. Then she set\\ndown the guitar on the floor and took a seat on the sofa, inviting me to\\nsit next to her and dividing what wine was left between our two\\nglasses. \"Naoko is fine,\" she said, touching my knee. \"Don\\'t worry, all she has\\nto do is rest for a while. She\\'ll calm down. She was just a little worked\\nup. How about taking a walk with me in the meantime?\" \"Good,\" I said. Reiko and I ambled down a road illuminated by street lamps. When\\nwe reached the area by the tennis and basketball courts, we sat on a\\nbench. She picked up a basketball from under the bench and tinned it\\nin her hands. Then she asked me if I played tennis. I knew how to\\nplay, I said, but I was bad at it. \"How about basketball?\" \"Not my strongest sport,\" I said. \"What is your strongest sport?\" Reiko asked, wrinkling the corners of\\nher eyes with a smile. \"Aside from sleeping with girls.\" \"I\\'m not so good at that, either,\" I said, stung by her words. \"Just\\nkidding,\" she said. \"Don\\'t get angry. But really, though, what \\nare\\n you\\ngood at?\" \"Nothing special. I have things I \\nlike\\n to do.\" \"For instance?\" \"Hiking. Swimming. Reading.\" \"You like to do things alone, then?\" \"I guess so. I could never get excited about games you play with other\\npeople. I can\\'t get into them. I lose interest.\" \"Then you \\nhave\\n to come here in the winter. We do crosscountry\\nskiing. I\\'m sure you\\'d like that, tramping around in the snow all day,\\nworking up a good sweat.\" Under the street lamp, Reiko stared at her\\nright hand as though she were inspecting an antique musical\\ninstrument. \"Does Naoko often get like that?\" I asked. \"Every now and then,\" said Reiko, now looking at her left hand.\\n\"Every once in a while she\\'ll get worked up and cry like that. But\\nthat\\'s OK. She\\'s letting out her feelings. The scary thing is not being\\nable to do that. When your feelings build up and harden and die\\ninside, then you\\'re in big trouble.\" \"Did I say something I shouldn’t have?\" \"Not a thing. Don\\'t worry. Just speak your mind honestly That\\'s the\\nbest thing. It may hurt a little sometimes, and someone may get upset\\nthe way Naoko did. but in the long run it\\'s for the best. That\\'s what\\nyou should do if you\\'re serious about making Naoko well again. Like I\\ntold you in the beginning, you should think not so much about\\nwanting to help her as wanting to recover yourself by helping her to\\nrecover. That\\'s the way it\\'s done here. So you have to be honest and\\nsay everything that comes to mind, while you\\'re here at least. Nobody\\ndoes that in the outside world, right?\" \"I guess not,\" I said. \"I\\'ve seen all kinds of people come and go in my time here,\" she said,\\n\"maybe \\ntoo\\n many people. So I can usually tell by looking at a person\\nwhether they\\'re going to get better or not, almost by instinct. But in\\nNaoko\\'s case. I\\'m not sure. I have absolutely no idea what\\'s going to\\nhappen to her. For all I know, she could be 100 per cent recovered\\nnext month, or she could go on like this for years. So I really can\\'t tell\\nyou what to do aside from the most generalized kind of advice: to be\\nhonest and help each other.\" \"What makes Naoko such a hard case for you?\" \"Probably because I like her so much. I think my emotions get in the\\nway and I can\\'t see her clearly. I mean, I really like her. But aside\\nfrom that, she has a bundle of different problems that are all tangled\\nup with each other so that it\\'s hard to unravel a single one. It may take\\na very long time to undo them all, or something could trigger them to\\ncome unravelled all at once. It\\'s kind of like that. Which is why I can\\'t\\nbe sure about her.\" She picked up the basketball again, twirled it in her hands and\\nbounced it on the ground. \"The most important thing is not to let yourself get impatient,\" Reiko\\nsaid. \"This is one more piece of advice I have for you: don\\'t get\\nimpatient. Even if things are so tangled up you can\\'t do anything, don\\'t\\nget desperate or blow a fuse and start yanking on one particular thread\\nbefore it\\'s ready to come undone. You have to realize it\\'s going to be a\\nlong process and that you\\'ll work on things slowly, one at a time. Do\\nyou think you can do that?\" \"I can try,\" I said. \"It may take a very long time, you know, and even then she may not\\nrecover completely. Have you thought about that?\" I nodded. \"Waiting is hard,\" she said, bouncing the ball. \"Especially for\\nsomeone your age. You just sit and wait for her to get better. Without\\ndeadlines or guarantees. Do you think you can do that? Do you love\\nNaoko that much ?\" \"I\\'m not sure,\" I said honestly. \"Like Naoko, I\\'m not really sure what it\\nmeans to love another person. Though she meant it a little differently.\\nI do want to try my best, though. I have to, or else I won\\'t know where\\nto go. Like you said before, Naoko and I have to save each other. It\\'s\\nthe only way for either of us to be saved.\" \"And are you going to go on sleeping with girls you pick up?\" \"I don\\'t know what to do about that either,\" I said. \"What do you\\nthink? Should I just keep waiting and masturbating? I\\'m not in\\ncomplete control there, either.\" Reiko set the ball on the ground and patted my knee. \"Look,\" she said,\\n\"I\\'m not telling you to stop sleeping with girls. If you\\'re OK with that,\\nthen it\\'s OK. It\\'s \\nyour\\n life after all, it\\'s something you have to decide.\\nAll I\\'m saying is you shouldn\\'t use yourself up in some unnatural\\nform. Do )ou see what I\\'m getting at? It would be such a waste. The\\nyears 19 and 20 are a crucial stage in the maturation of character, and\\nif you allow yourself to become warped when you\\'re that age, it will cause you pain when you\\'re older. It\\'s true. So think about\\nit carefully. If you want to take care of Naoko, take care of yourself,\\ntoo.\" I said I would think about it. \"I was 20 myself. Once upon a time. Would you believe it?\" \"I believe it. Of course.\" \"Deep down?\" \"Deep down,\" I said with a smile. \"And I was cute, too. Not as cute as Naoko, but pretty damn cute. I\\ndidn\\'t have all these wrinkles.\" I said I liked her wrinkles a lot. She thanked me. \"But don’t ever tell another woman that you find her wrinkles\\nattractive,\" she added. \"I like to hear it, but I\\'m the exception.\" \"I\\'ll be careful,\" I said. She slipped a wallet from her trouser pocket and handed me a photo\\nfrom the card-holder. It was a colour snapshot of a cute girl around ten\\nyears old wearing skis and a brightly coloured ski-suit, standing on the\\nsnow smiling sweetly for the camera. \"Isn\\'t she pretty? My daughter,\" said Reiko. \"She sent me this in\\nJanuary. She\\'s - what? - nine years old now.\" \"She has your smile,\" I said, returning the photo. Reiko pocketed the\\nwallet and. with a sniff, put a cigarette between her lips and lit up. \"I was going to be a concert pianist,\" she said. \"I had talent, and\\npeople recognized it and made a fuss over me while I was growing up.\\nI won competitions and had top marks in the conservatoire, and I was\\nall set to study in Germany after graduation. Not a cloud on the\\nhorizon. Everything worked out perfectly, and when it didn\\'t there was\\nalways somebody to fix it. But then one day something happened, and\\nit all blew apart. I was in my final year at the conservatoire and there\\nwas a fairly important competition coming up. I practised for it\\nconstantly, but all of a sudden the little finger of my left hand stopped\\nmoving. I don’t know why, but it just did. I tried massaging it, soaking it in hot water, taking a few days off from practice: nothing worked.\\nSo then I got scared and went to the doctor\\'s. They tried all kinds of\\ntests but they couldn’t come up with anything. There was nothing\\nwrong with the finger itself, and the nerves were OK, they said: there\\nwas no reason it should stop moving. The problem must be\\npsychological. So I went to a psychiatrist, but he didn\\'t really know\\nwhat was going on, either. Probably pre-competition stress, he said,\\nand advised me to get away from the piano for a while.\" Reiko inhaled deeply and let the smoke out. Then she bent her neck to\\nthe side a few times. \"So I went to recuperate at my grandmother\\'s place on the coast in Izu.\\nI thought I\\'d forget about that particular competition and really relax,\\nspend a couple of weeks away from the piano doing anything I\\nwanted. But it was hopeless. Piano was all I could think about. Maybe\\nmy finger would never move again. How would I live if that\\nhappened? The same thoughts kept going round and round in my\\nbrain. And no wonder: piano had been my whole life up to that point. I\\nhad started playing when I was four and grew up thinking about the\\npiano and nothing else. I never did housework so as not to injure my\\nfingers. People paid attention to me for that one thing: my talent at the\\npiano. Take the piano away from a girl who\\'s grown up like that, and\\nwhat\\'s left? So then, \\nsnap! MY\\n mind became a complete jumble. Total\\ndarkness.\" She dropped her cigarette to the ground and stamped it out, then bent\\nher neck a few times again. \"That was the end of my dream of becoming a concert pianist. I spent\\ntwo months in the hospital. My finger started to move shortly after I\\narrived, so I \\nwas\\n able to return to the conservatoire and graduate, but\\nsomething inside me had vanished. Some jewel of energy or\\nsomething had disappeared - evaporated - from inside my body. The\\ndoctor said I lacked the mental strength to become a professional\\npianist and advised me to abandon the idea. So after graduating I took pupils and taught them at home. But the pain I felt was excruciating. It\\nwas as if my life had ended. Here I was in my early twenties and the\\nbest part of my life was over. Do you see how terrible that would be? I\\nhad such potential, then woke up one day and it had gone. No more\\napplause, no one would make a big fuss over me. no one would tell\\nme how wonderful I was. I spent day after day in the house teaching\\nneighbourhood children Beyer exercises and sonatinas. I felt so\\nmiserable, I cried all the time. To think what I had missed! I would\\nhear about people who were far less talented than me winning second\\nplace in a competition or holding a recital in such-and-such a hall, and\\nthe tears would pour out of me. \"My parents walked around on tiptoe, afraid of hurting me. But I\\nknew how disappointed they were. All of a sudden the daughter they\\nhad been so proud of was an ex-mental-patient. They couldn\\'t even\\nmarry me off. When you\\'re living with people, you sense what they\\'re\\nfeeling, and I hated it. I was afraid to go out, afraid the neighbours\\nwere talking about me. So then, \\nsnap!\\n It happened again - the jumble,\\nthe darkness. It happened when I was 24, and this time I spent seven\\nmonths in a sanatorium. Not this place: a regular insane asylum with\\nhigh walls and locked gates. A filthy place without pianos. I didn’t\\nknow what to do with myself. All I knew was I wanted to get out of\\nthere as soon as I could, so I straggled desperately to get better. Seven\\nmonths: a long seven months. That\\'s when my wrinkles started.\" Reiko smiled, her lips stretching from side to side. \"I hadn\\'t been out of the hospital for long when I met a man and got\\nmarried. He was a year younger than me, an engineer who worked in\\nan aeroplane manufacturing company, and one of my pupils. A nice\\nman. He didn\\'t say a lot, but he was warm and sincere. He had been\\ntaking lessons from me for six months when all of a sudden he asked\\nme to marry him. Just like that - one day when we were having tea\\nafter his lesson. Can you believe it? We had never dated or held\\nhands. He took me totally off guard. I told him I couldn\\'t get married. I said I liked him and thought he was a nice person but that, for certain\\nreasons, I couldn’t marry him. He wanted to know what those reasons\\nwere, so I explained everything to him with complete honesty - that I\\nhad been hospitalized twice for mental breakdowns. I told him\\neverything -\\n what the cause had been, my condition, and the\\npossibility that it could happen again. He said he needed time to think,\\nand I encouraged him to take all the time he needed. But when he\\ncame for his lesson a week later, he said he still wanted to marry me. I\\nasked him to wait three months. We would see each other for three\\nmonths, I said, and if he still wanted to marry me at that point, we\\nwould talk about it again. \"We dated once a week for three months. We went everywhere, and\\ntalked about everything, and I got to like him a lot. When I was with\\nhim, I felt as if my life had finally come back to me. It gave me a\\nwonderful sense of relief to be alone with him: I could forget all those\\nterrible things that had happened. So what if I hadn\\'t been able to\\nbecome a concert pianist? So what if I had spent time in mental\\nhospitals? My life hadn\\'t ended. Life was still full of wonderful things\\nI hadn\\'t experienced. If only for having made me feel that way, I felt\\ntremendously grateful to him. After three months went by, he asked\\nme again to marry him. And this is what I said to him: \"If you want to\\nsleep with me, I don\\'t mind. I\\'ve never slept with anybody, and I\\'m\\nvery fond of \\nyou,\\n so if you want to make love to me, I don\\'t mind at\\nall. But marrying me is a whole different matter. If you marry me, you\\ntake on all my troubles, and they\\'re a lot worse than you can imagine.\\n\"He said he didn\\'t care, that he didn\\'t just want to sleep with me, he\\nwanted to marry me, to share everything I had inside me. And he\\nmeant it. He was the kind of person who would only say what he\\nreally meant, and do anything he said. So I agreed to marry him. It\\nwas all I could do. We got married, let\\'s see, four months later I think\\nit was. He fought with his parents over me, and they disowned him.\\nHe was from an old family that lived in a rural part of Shikoku. They had my background investigated and found out that I had been\\nhospitalized twice. No wonder they opposed the marriage. So,\\nanyway, we didn\\'t have a wedding ceremony. We just went to the\\nregistry office and registered our marriage and took a trip to Hakone\\nfor two nights. That was plenty for us: we were happy. And finally, I\\nremained a virgin until the day I married. I was 25 years old! Can you\\nbelieve it?\" Reiko sighed and picked up the basketball again. \"I thought that as long as I was with him, I would be all right,\" she\\nwent on. \"As long as I was with him, my troubles would stay away.\\nThat’s the most important thing for a sickness like ours: a sense of\\ntrust. If I put myself in this person\\'s hands. I\\'ll be OK. If my condition\\nstarts to worsen even the slightest bit - if a screw comes loose - he\\'ll\\nnotice straight away, and with tremendous care and patience he\\'ll fix\\nit, he\\'ll tighten the screw again, put all the jumbled threads back in\\nplace. If we have that sense of trust, our sickness stays away. No more\\nsnap! I was so happy! Life was great! I felt as if someone had pulled\\nme out of a cold, raging sea and wrapped me in a blanket and laid me\\nin a warm bed. I had a baby two years after we were married, and then\\nmy hands were really full! I practically forgot about my sickness. I’d\\nget up in the morning and do the housework and take care of the baby\\nand feed my husband when he came home from work. It was the same\\nthing day after day, but I was happy. It was probably the happiest time\\nof my life. How many years did it last, I wonder? At least until I was\\n31. And then, all of a sudden, \\nsnap!\\n It happened again. I fell apart.\"\\nReiko lit a cigarette. The wind had died down. The smoke rose\\nstraight up and disappeared into the darkness of night. Just then I\\nrealized that the sky was filled with stars. \"Something happened?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" she said, \"something very strange, as if a trap had been laid for\\nme. Even now, it gives me a chill just to think about it.\" Reiko rubbed\\na temple with her free hand. \"I\\'m sorry, though, making you listen to all this talk about me. You came here to see Naoko, not listen to my\\nstory.\" \"I\\'d really like to hear it, though,\" I said. \"If you don\\'t mind. I\\'d like to\\nhear the rest.\" \"Well,\" Reiko began, \"when our daughter entered kindergarten, I\\nstarted playing again, little by little. Not for anyone else, but for\\nmyself. I started with short pieces by Bach, Mozart, Scarlatti. After\\nsuch a long blank period, of course, my feel for the music didn’t come\\nback straight away. And my fingers wouldn\\'t move the way they used\\nto. But I was thrilled to be playing the piano again. With my hands on\\nthe keys, I realized how much I had loved music - and how much I\\nhungered for it. To be able to perform music for yourself is a\\nwonderful thing. \"As I said before, I had been playing from the time I was four years\\nold, but it occurred to me that I had never once played for myself. I\\nhad always been trying to pass a test or practise an assignment or\\nimpress somebody. Those are all important things, of course, if you\\nare going to master an instrument. But after a certain age you have to\\nstart performing for yourself. That’s what music is. I had to drop out of\\nthe elite course and pass my thirty-first birthday before I was finally\\nable to see that. I would send my child off to kindergarten and hurry\\nthrough the housework, then spend an hour or two playing music I\\nliked. So far so good, right?\" I nodded. \"Then one day I had a visit from one of the ladies of the\\nneighbourhood, someone I at least knew well enough to say hello to\\non the street, asking me to give her daughter piano lessons. I didn\\'t\\nknow the daughter - although we lived in the same general\\nneighbourhood our houses were still pretty far apart - but according to\\nthe woman, her daughter used to pass my house and loved to hear me\\nplay. She had seen me at some point, too, and now she was pestering\\nher mother to let me teach her. She was in her fourth year of school and had taken lessons from a number of people but things had not\\ngone well for one reason or another and now she had no teacher. \"I turned her down. I had had that blank of several years, and while it\\nmight have made sense for me to take on an absolute beginner, it\\nwould have been impossible for me to pick up with someone who had\\nhad lessons for a number of years. Besides, I was too busy taking care\\nof my own child and. though I didn’t say this to the woman, nobody\\ncan deal with the kind of child who changes teachers constantly. So\\nthen the woman asked me to at least do her daughter the favour of\\nmeeting her once. She was a fairly pushy lady and I could see she was\\nnot going to let me off the hook that easily, so I agreed to meet the girl\\n- but \\njust meet\\n her. Three days later the girl came to the house by\\nherself. She was an absolute angel, with a kind of pure, sweet,\\ntransparent beauty. I had never - and have never - seen such a\\nbeautiful little girl. She had long, shiny hair as black as freshly ground\\nIndian ink, slim, graceful arms and legs, bright eyes, and a soft little\\nmouth that looked as if someone had just made it. I couldn’t speak\\nwhen I first saw her, she was so beautiful. Sitting on my sofa, she\\nturned my living room into a gorgeous parlour. It hurt to look directly\\nat her: I had to squint. So, anyway, that\\'s what she was like. I can still\\npicture her clearly.\" Reiko narrowed her eyes as if she were actually picturing the girl. \"Over coffee we talked for a whole hour - talked about all kinds of\\nthings: music, her school, just everything. I could see straight away\\nshe was a smart one. She knew how to hold a conversation: she had\\nclear, shrewd opinions and a natural gift for drawing out the other\\nperson. It was almost frightening. Exactly what it was that made her\\nfrightening, I couldn\\'t tell at the time. It just struck me how\\nfrighteningly intelligent she was. But in her presence I lost any normal\\npowers of judgement I might have had. She was so young and\\nbeautiful, I felt overwhelmed to the point where I saw myself as an\\ninferior specimen, a clumsy excuse for a human being who could only have negative thoughts about her because of my own warped and\\nfilthy mind.\" Reiko shook her head several times. \"If I were as pretty and smart as she was. I\\'d have been\\na normal human being. What more could you want if you were that\\nsmart and that beautiful? Why would you have to torment and walk all\\nover your weaker inferiors if everybody loved you so much? What\\nreason could there possibly be for acting that way?\" \"Did she do something terrible to you?\" \"Well, let me just say the girl was a pathological liar. She was sick,\\npine and simple. She made up everything. And while she was making\\nup her stories, she would come to believe them. And then she would\\nchange things around her to fit her story. She had such a quick mind,\\nshe could always keep a step ahead of you and take care of things that\\nwould ordinarily strike you as odd. so it would never cross your mind\\nshe was lying. First of all, no one would ever suspect that such a pretty\\nlittle girl would lie about the most ordinary things. I certainly didn\\'t.\\nShe told me tons of lies for six months before I had the slightest\\ninkling anything was wrong. She lied about \\neverything,\\n and I never\\nsuspected. I know it sounds crazy.\" \"What did she lie about?\" \"When I say everything, I mean \\neverything.\"\\n Reiko gave a sarcastic\\nlaugh. \"When people tell a lie about something, they have to make up\\na bunch of lies to go with the first one. ’Mythomania’ is the word for it.\\nWhen the usual mythomaniac tells lies, they\\'re usually the innocent\\nkind, and most people notice. But not with that girl. To protect herself,\\nshe’d tell hurtful lies without batting an eyelid. She\\'d use everything\\nshe could get her hands on. And she would lie either more or less\\ndepending on who she was talking to. To her mother or close friends\\nwho would know straight away, she hardly ever lied, or if she had to\\ntell one, she\\'d be really, really careful to tell lies that wouldn\\'t come\\nout. Or if they did come out, she’d find an excuse or apologize in that clingy voice of hers with tears pouring out of her beautiful eyes. No\\none could stay mad at her then. \"I still don\\'t know why she chose me. Was I another victim to her, or a\\nsource of salvation? I just don\\'t know. Of course, it hardly matters\\nnow. Now that everything is over. Now that I\\'m like this.\" A short silence followed. \"She repeated what her mother had told me, that she had been moved\\nwhen she heard me playing as she passed the house. She had seen me\\non the street a few times, too, and had begun to worship me. She\\nactually used that word: \"worship\\'. It made me turn bright red. I mean,\\nto be \"worshipped\\' by such a beautiful little doll of a girl! I don\\'t think\\nit was an absolute lie, though. I was in my thirties already, of course,\\nand I could never be as beautiful and bright as she was, and I had no\\nspecial talent, but I must have had something that drew her to me,\\nsomething that was missing in her, I suppose. That must have been\\nwhat got her interested in me to begin with. I believe that now,\\nlooking back. And I\\'m not boasting.\" \"No, I think I know what you mean.\" \"She had brought some music with her and asked if she could play for\\nme. So I let her. It was a Bach invention. Her performance was ..\\ninteresting. Or should I say strange? It just wasn\\'t ordinary. Of course\\nit wasn\\'t polished. She hadn\\'t been going to a professional school, and\\nwhat lessons she had taken had been an on-and-off kind of thing; she\\nwas very much self-taught. Her sound was untrained. She\\'d have been\\nrejected immediately at a music-school audition. But she made it\\nwork. Although 90 per cent was just terrible, the other 10 per cent was\\nthere: she made it sing: it was music. And this was a Bach invention!\\nSo I got interested in her. I wanted to know what she was all about.\\n\"Needless to say, the world is full of kids who can play Bach far better\\nthan she could. Twenty times better. But most of their performances\\nwould have nothing to them. They’d be hollow, empty. This girl\\'s\\ntechnique was bad, but she had that little bit of something that could draw people - or draw me, at least - into her performance. So I decided\\nit might be worthwhile to teach her. Of course, retraining her at that\\npoint to where she could become a pro was out of the question. But I\\nfelt it might be possible to make her into the kind of happy pianist I\\nwas then - and still am - someone who could enjoy making music for\\nherself. This turned out to be an empty hope, though. She was not the\\nkind of person who quietly goes about doing things for herself. This\\nwas a child who would make detailed calculations to use every means\\nat her disposal to impress other people. She knew exactly what she\\nhad to do to make people admire and praise her. And she knew exactly\\nwhat kind of performance it would take to draw me in. She had\\ncalculated everything. I\\'m sure, and put everything she had into\\npractising the most important passages over and over again for my\\nbenefit. I can see her doing it. \"Still, even now, after all of this came clear to me, I believe it was a\\nwonderful performance and I would feel the same chills down my\\nspine if I could hear it again. Knowing all I know about her flaws, her\\ncunning and lies, I would still feel it. I\\'m telling you, there are such\\nthings in this world.\" Reiko cleared her throat with a dry rasp and broke off. \"So, did you take her as a pupil?\" I asked. \"Yeah. One lesson a week. Saturday mornings. Saturday was a day off\\nat her school. She never missed a lesson, she was never late, she was\\nan ideal pupil. She always practised for her lessons. After every\\nlesson, we\\'d have some cake and chat.\" At that point, Reiko looked at her watch as if suddenly remembering\\nsomething. \"Don\\'t you think we should be getting back to the room? I\\'m a little\\nworried about Naoko. I\\'m sure you haven\\'t forgotten about her now,\\nhave you?\" \"Of course not,\" I laughed. \"It\\'s just that I was drawn into your story.\"\\n\"If you’d like to hear the rest. I\\'ll tell it to you tomorrow. It\\'s a long story - too long for one sitting.\" \"You\\'re a regular Scheherazade.\" \"I know,\" she said, joining her laughter with mine. \"You\\'ll never get\\nback to Tokyo.\" We retraced our steps through the path in the woods and returned to\\nthe flat. The candles had been extinguished and the living room lights\\nwere out. The bedroom door was open and the lamp on the night table\\nwas on, its pale light spilling into the living room. Naoko sat alone on\\nthe sofa in the gloom. She had changed into a loose-fitting blue gown,\\nits collar pulled tight about her neck, her legs folded under her on the\\nsofa. Reiko approached her and rested a hand on her crown. \"Are you all right now?\" \"I\\'m fine. Sorry,\" answered Naoko in a tiny voice. Then she turned\\ntowards me and repeated her apology. \"I must have scared you.\" \"A little,\" I said with a smile. \"Come here,\" she said. When I sat down next to her, Naoko, her legs\\nstill folded, leaned towards me until her face was nearly touching my\\near, as though she were about to share a secret with me. Then she\\nplanted a soft kiss by my ear. \"Sorry,\" she said once more, this time directly into my ear, her voice\\nsubdued. Then she moved away from me. \"Sometimes,\" she said, \"I get so confused, I don\\'t know what\\'s\\nhappening.\" \"That happens to me all the time,\" I said. Naoko smiled and looked at me. \"If you don\\'t mind.\" I said. \"I’d like to hear more about you. About\\nyour life here. What you do every day. The people you meet.\" Naoko talked about her daily routine in this place, speaking in short\\nbut crystal clear phrases. Wake up at six in the morning. Breakfast in\\nthe flat. Clean out the aviary. Then usually farm work. She took care\\nof the vegetables. Before or after lunch, she would have either an\\nhour-long session with her doctor or a group discussion. In the\\nafternoon she could choose from among courses that might interest her, outside work, or sports. She had taken several courses: French,\\nknitting, piano, ancient history. \"Reiko is teaching me piano,\" she said. \"She also teaches guitar. We\\nall take turns as pupils or teachers. Somebody with fluent French\\nteaches French, one person who used to be in social studies teaches\\nhistory, another good at knitting teaches knitting: that\\'s a pretty\\nimpressive school right there. Unfortunately, I don’t have anything I\\ncan teach anyone.\" \"Neither do I,\" I said. \"I put a lot more energy into my studies here than I ever did in\\nuniversity. I work hard and enjoy it - a lot.\" \"What do you do after supper?\" \"Talk with Reiko, read, listen to records, go to other people\\'s flats and\\nplay games, stuff like that.\" \"I do guitar practice and write my autobiography,\" said Reiko.\\n\"Autobiography?\" \"Just kidding,\" Reiko laughed. \"We go to bed around ten. Pretty\\nhealthy lifestyle, wouldn\\'t you say? We sleep like babies.\" I looked at my watch. It was a few minutes before nine. \"I guess you\\'ll\\nbe getting sleepy soon.\" \"That\\'s OK. We can stay up late today,\" said Naoko. \"I haven\\'t seen\\nyou in such a long time, I want to talk more. So talk.\" \"When I was alone before, all of a sudden I started thinking about the\\nold days,\" I said. \"Do you remember when Kizuki and I came to visit\\nyou at the hospital? The one on the seashore. I think it was the first\\nyear of the sixth-form.\" \"When I had the chest operation,\" Naoko said with a smile. \"Sure, I\\nremember. You and Kizuki came on a motorbike. You brought me a\\nbox of chocolates and they were all melted together. They were so\\nhard to eat! I don’t know, it seems like such a long time ago.\" \"Yeah, really. I think you were writing a poem then, a long one.\" \"All girls write poems at that age,\" Naoko tittered. \"What reminded you of that all of a sudden?\" \"I wonder. The smell of the sea wind, the oleanders: before I knew it,\\nthey just popped into my head. Did Kizuki come to see you at the\\nhospital a lot?\" \"No way! We had a big fight about that afterwards. He came once,\\nand then he came with you, and that was it for him. He was terrible.\\nAnd that first time he couldn’t sit still and he only stayed about ten\\nminutes. He brought me some oranges and mumbled all this stuff I\\ncouldn’t understand, and he peeled an orange for me and mumbled\\nmore stuff and he was out of there. He said he had a thing about\\nhospitals.\" Naoko laughed. \"He was always a kid about that kind of stuff. I mean,\\nnobody likes hospitals, right? That\\'s why people visit people in\\nhospitals to make them feel better, and perk up their spirits and stuff.\\nBut Kizuki just didn’t get it.\" \"He wasn\\'t so bad when the two of us came to see you, though. He\\nwas just his usual self.\" \"Because you were there,\" said Naoko. \"He was always like that\\naround you. He struggled to keep his weaknesses hidden. I\\'m sure he\\nwas very fond of you. He made a point of letting you see only his best\\nside. He wasn\\'t like that with me. He\\'d let his guard down. He could\\nbe really moody. One minute he’d be chattering away, and the next\\nhe\\'d be depressed. It happened all the time. He was like that from the\\ntime he was little. He did keep trying to change himself, to improve\\nhimself, though.\" Naoko re-crossed her legs on the sofa. \"He tried hard, but it didn’t do any good, and that would make him\\nreally angry and sad. There was so much about him that was fine and\\nbeautiful, but he could never find the confidence he needed. \"I\\'ve got\\nto do that. I\\'ve got to change this,\\' he was always thinking, right up to\\nthe end. Poor Kizuki!\" \"Still,\" I said, \"if it\\'s true that he was always straggling to show me his best side. I\\'d say he succeeded. His best side was all that I could see.\"\\nNaoko smiled. \"He\\'d be thrilled if he could hear you say that. You\\nwere his only friend.\" \"And Kizuki was my only friend,\" I said. \"There was never anybody I\\ncould really call a friend, before him or after him.\" \"That\\'s why I loved being with the two of you. His best side was all\\nthat I could see then, too. I could relax and stop worrying when the\\nthree of us were together. Those were my favourite times. I don\\'t\\nknow how \\nyou\\n felt about it.\" \"I used to worry about what \\nyou\\n were thinking,\" I said, giving my\\nhead a shake. \"The problem was that that kind of thing couldn’t go on for ever,\" said\\nNaoko. \"Such perfect little circles are impossible to maintain. Kizuki\\nknew it, and I knew it, and so did you. Am I right?\" I nodded. \"To tell you the truth, though,\" Naoko went on, \"I loved his weak side,\\ntoo. I loved it as much as I loved his good side. There was absolutely\\nnothing mean or underhand about him. He was weak: that\\'s all. I tried\\nto tell him that, but he wouldn\\'t believe me. He’d always tell me it was\\nbecause we had been together since we were three. I knew him too\\nwell, he\\'d say: I couldn\\'t tell the difference between his strong points\\nand his flaws, they were all the same to me. He couldn’t change my\\nmind about him, though. I went on loving him just the same, and I\\ncould never be interested in anyone else.\" Naoko looked at me with a sad smile. \"Our boy-girl relationship was really unusual, too. It was as if we\\nwere physically joined somewhere. If we happened to be apart, some\\nspecial gravitational force would pull us back together again. It was\\nthe most natural thing in the world when we became boyfriend and\\ngirlfriend. It was nothing we had to think about or make any choices\\nabout. We started kissing at 12 and petting at 13. I\\'d go to his room or he\\'d come to my room and I’d finish him off with my hands. It never\\noccurred to me that we were being precocious. It just happened as a\\nmatter of course. If he wanted to play with my breasts or pussy, I\\ndidn’t mind at all, or if he had cum he wanted to get rid of, I didn’t\\nmind helping him with that, either. I\\'m sure it would have shocked us\\nboth if someone had accused us of doing anything wrong. Because we\\nweren\\'t. We were just doing what we were supposed to do. We had always\\nshown each other every part of our bodies. It was almost as if we\\nowned each other\\'s bodies jointly. For a while, at least, we made sure\\nwe didn’t go any further than that, though. We were afraid of my\\ngetting pregnant, and had almost no idea at that point of how to go\\nabout preventing it ... Anyway, that\\'s how Kizuki and I grew up\\ntogether, hand in hand, an inseparable pair. We had almost no sense of\\nthe oppressiveness of sex or the anguish that comes with the sudden\\nswelling of the ego that ordinary kids experience when they reach\\npuberty. We were totally open about sex, and where our egos were\\nconcerned, the way we absorbed and shared each other\\'s, we had no\\nstrong awareness of them. Do you see what I mean?\" \"I think so,\" I said. \"We couldn\\'t bear to be apart. So if Kizuki had lived. I’m sure we\\nwould have been together, loving each other, and gradually growing\\nunhappy.\" \"Unhappy? Why’s that?\" With her fingers, Naoko combed her hair back several times. She had\\ntaken her hairslide off, which made the hair fall over her face when\\nshe dropped her head forward. \"Because we would have had to pay the world back what we owed it,\"\\nshe said, raising her eyes to mine. \"The pain of growing up. We didn’t\\npay when we should have, so now the bills are due. Which is why\\nKizuki did what he did, and why I’m here. We were like kids who\\ngrew up naked on a desert island. If we got hungry, we’d just pick a banana; if we got lonely, we\\'d go to sleep in each other\\'s arms. But\\nthat kind of thing doesn\\'t last for ever. We grew up fast and had to\\nenter society. Which is why you were so important to us. You were\\nthe link connecting us with the outside. We were straggling through\\nyou to fit in with the outside world as best we could. In the end. it\\ndidn\\'t work, of course.\" I nodded. \"I wouldn’t want you to think that we were using you, though. Kizuki\\nreally loved you. It just so happened that our connection with you was\\nour first connection with anyone else. And it still is. Kizuki may be\\ndead, but you are still My only link with the outside world. And just as\\nKizuki loved you, I love you. We never meant to hurt you, but we\\nprobably did; we probably ended up making a deep wound in your\\nheart. It never occurred to us that anything like that might happen.\"\\nNaoko lowered her head again and fell silent. \"Hey, how about a cup of cocoa?\" suggested Reiko. \"Good. I\\'d really like some,\" said Naoko. \"I\\'d like to have some of that brandy I brought, if you don\\'t mind,\" I\\nsaid. \"Oh, absolutely,\" said Reiko. \"Could I have a sip?\" \"Sure,\" I said,\\nlaughing. Reiko brought out two glasses and we toasted each other. Then she\\nwent into the kitchen to make cocoa. \"Can we talk about something a little more cheerful?\" asked Naoko. I didn’t have anything cheerful to talk about. I thought. If only Storm\\nTrooper were still around! That guy could inspire a string of stories. A\\nfew of those would have made everybody feel good. The best I could\\ndo was talk at length about the filthy habits of the guys in the\\ndormitory. I felt sick just talking about something so gross, but Naoko\\nand Reiko practically fell over laughing, it was all so new to them.\\nNext Reiko did imitations of mental patients. This was a lot of fun,\\ntoo. Naoko started looking sleepy after eleven o\\'clock, so Reiko let down the sofa back and handed me a pillow, sheets and blankets. \"If you feel like raping anybody in the middle of the night, don\\'t get\\nthe wrong one,\" she said. \"The unwrinkled body in the left bed is\\nNaoko’s.\" \"Liar! Mine\\'s the right bed,\" said Naoko. Reiko added, \"By the way, I arranged for us to skip some of our\\nafternoon schedule. Why don\\'t the three of us have a little picnic? I\\nknow a really nice place close by.\" \"Good idea,\" I said. The women took turns brushing their teeth and withdrew to the\\nbedroom. I poured myself some brandy and stretched out on the sofa\\nbed, going over the day\\'s events from morning to night. It felt like an\\nawfully long day. The room continued to glow white in the moonlight.\\nAside from the occasional slight creak of a bed, hardly a sound came\\nfrom the bedroom where Naoko and Reiko lay sleeping. Tiny\\ndiagrammatic shapes seemed to float in the darkness when I closed\\nmy eyes, and my ears sensed the lingering reverberation of Reiko\\'s\\nguitar, but neither of these lasted for long. Sleep came and carried me\\ninto a mass of warm mud. I dreamed of willows. Both sides of a\\nmountain road were lined with willows. An incredible number of\\nwillows. A fairly stiff breeze was blowing, but the branches of the\\nwillow trees never swayed. Why should that be? I wondered, and then\\nI saw that every branch of every tree had tiny birds clinging to it.\\nTheir weight kept the branches from stirring. I grabbed a stick and hit\\na nearby branch with it, hoping to chase away the birds and allow the\\nbranch to sway. But they would not leave. Instead of flying away, they\\nturned into bird-shaped metal chunks that crashed to the ground. When I opened my eyes, I felt as if I were seeing the continuation of\\nmy dream. The moonlight filled the room with the same soft white\\nglow. As if by reflex, I sat up in bed and started searching for the\\nmetal birds, which of course were not there. What I saw instead was\\nNaoko at the foot of the bed, sitting still and alone, staring out through the window. She had drawn her knees up and was resting her chin on\\nthem, looking like a hungry orphan. I searched for the watch I had left\\nby my pillow, but it was not in the place where I knew it should be. I\\nguessed from the angle of the moonlight that the time must be two or\\nthree o\\'clock in the morning. I felt a violent thirst but I decided to keep\\nstill and continue watching Naoko. She was wearing the same blue\\nnightdress I had seen her in earlier, and on one side her hair was held\\nin place by the butterfly hairslide, revealing the beauty of her face in\\nthe moonlight. Strange, I thought, she had taken the slide off before\\ngoing to bed. Naoko stayed frozen in place, like a small nocturnal animal that has\\nbeen lured out by the moonlight. The direction of the glow\\nexaggerated the silhouette of her lips. Seeming utterly fragile and\\nvulnerable, the silhouette pulsed almost imperceptibly with the\\nbeating of her heart or the motions of her inner heart, as if she were\\nwhispering soundless words to the darkness. I swallowed in hopes of easing my thirst, but in the stillness of the\\nnight the sound I made was huge. As if this were a signal to her,\\nNaoko stood and glided towards the head of the bed, gown rustling\\nfaintly. She knelt on the floor by my pillow, eyes fixed on mine. I\\nstared back at her, but her eyes told me nothing. Strangely transparent,\\nthey seemed like windows to a world beyond, but however long I\\npeered into their depths, there was nothing I could see. Our faces were\\nno more than ten inches apart, but she was light years away from me. I reached out and tried to touch her, but Naoko drew back, lips\\ntrembling faintly. A moment later, she brought her hands\\nup and began slowly to undo the buttons of her gown. There were\\nseven in all. I felt as if it were the continuation of my dream as I\\nwatched her slim, lovely fingers opening the buttons one by one from\\ntop to bottom. Seven small, white buttons: when she had unfastened\\nthem all, Naoko slipped the gown from her shoulders and threw it off\\ncompletely like an insect shedding its skin. She had been wearing nothing under the gown. All she had on was the butterfly hairslide.\\nNaked now, and still kneeling by the bed, she looked at me. Bathed in\\nthe soft light of the moon, Naoko\\'s body had the heartbreaking lustre\\nof newborn flesh. When she moved - and she did so almost\\nimperceptibly - the play of light and shadow on her body shifted\\nsubtly. The swelling roundness of her breasts, her tiny nipples, the\\nindentation of her navel, her hipbones and pubic hair, all cast grainy\\nshadows, the shapes of which kept changing like ripples spreading\\nover the calm surface of a lake. What perfect flesh! I thought. When had Naoko come to possess such\\na perfect body? What had happened to the body I held in my arms that\\nnight last spring? A sense of imperfection had been what Naoko\\'s body had given me\\nthat night as I tenderly undressed her while she cried. Her breasts had\\nseemed hard, the nipples oddly jutting, the hips strangely rigid. She\\nwas a beautiful girl, of course, her body marvellous and alluring. It\\naroused me that night and swept me along with a gigantic force. But\\nstill, as I held her and caressed her and kissed her naked flesh, I felt a\\nstrange and powerful awareness of the imbalance and awkwardness of\\nthe human body. Holding Naoko in my arms, I wanted to explain to\\nher, \"I am having sex with you now. I am inside you. But really this is\\nnothing. It doesn\\'t matter. It is nothing but the joining of two bodies.\\nAll we are doing is telling each other things that can only be told by\\nthe rubbing together of two imperfect lumps of flesh. By doing this,\\nwe are sharing our imperfection.\" But of course I could never have\\nsaid such a thing with any hope of being understood. I just went on\\nholding her tightly. And as I did so, I was able to feel inside her body\\nsome kind of stony foreign matter, something extra that I could never\\ndraw close to. And that sensation both filled my heart for Naoko and\\ngave my erection a terrifying intensity. The body that Naoko revealed before me now, though, was nothing\\nlike the one I had held that night. This flesh had been through many changes to be reborn in utter perfection beneath the light of the moon.\\nAll signs of girlish plumpness had been stripped away since Kizuki\\'s\\ndeath to be replaced by the flesh of a mature woman. So perfect was\\nNaoko\\'s physical beauty now that it aroused nothing sexual in me. I\\ncould only stare, astounded, at the lovely curve from waist to hips, the\\nrounded richness of the breasts, the gentle movement with each breath\\nof the slim belly and the soft, black pubic shadow beneath. She exposed her nakedness to me this way for perhaps five minutes\\nuntil, at last, she wrapped herself in her gown once more and buttoned\\nit from top to bottom. As soon as the final button was in place, she\\nrose and glided towards the bedroom, silently opened the door, and\\ndisappeared. I stayed rooted to the spot for a very long time until it occurred to me\\nto leave the bed. I retrieved my watch from where it had fallen on the\\nfloor and turned it towards the light of the moon. It was 3.40.1 went to\\nthe kitchen and drank a few glasses of water before stretching out in\\nbed again, but sleep never came until the morning sunlight crept into\\nevery corner of the room, dissolving all traces of the moon\\'s pale\\nglow. I was somewhere on the edge of sleep when Reiko came and slapped\\nme on the cheek, shouting, \"Morning! Morning!\" While Reiko straightened out my sofa bed, Naoko went to the kitchen\\nand started making breakfast. She smiled at me and said \"Good\\nmorning\". \"Good morning,\" I replied. I stood by and watched her as she put on\\nwater to boil and sliced some bread, humming all the while, but I\\ncould sense nothing in her manner to suggest that she had revealed her\\nnaked body to me the night before. \"Your eyes are red,\" she said to me as she poured the coffee. \"Are you\\nOK?\" \"I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn\\'t get back to sleep.\" \"I bet we were snoring,\" said Reiko. \"Not at all,\" I said. \"That\\'s good,\" said Naoko. \"He\\'s just being polite,\" said Reiko, yawning. At first I thought that Naoko was embarrassed or acting innocent for\\nReiko, but her behaviour remained unchanged when Reiko\\nmomentarily left the room, and her eyes had their usual transparent\\nlook. \"How’d you sleep?\" I asked Naoko. \"Like a log,\" she answered with ease. She wore a simple hairpin\\nwithout any kind of decoration. I didn\\'t know what to make of this, and I continued to feel that way all\\nthrough breakfast. Buttering my bread or peeling my egg, I kept\\nglancing across the table at Naoko, in search of a sign. \"Why do you keep looking at me like that?\" she asked with a smile. \"I think he’s in love with somebody,\" said Reiko. \"Are you\\n in love with somebody?\" Naoko asked me. \"Could be,\" I said, returning her smile. When the two women started\\njoking around at my expense, I gave up trying to think about what had\\nhappened in the night and concentrated on my bread and coffee. After breakfast, Reiko and Naoko said they would be going to feed the\\nbirds in the aviary. I volunteered to go along. They changed into jeans\\nand work shirts and white rubber boots. Set in a little park behind the\\ntennis courts, the aviary had everything in it from chickens and\\npigeons to peacocks and parrots and was surrounded by flowerbeds,\\nshrubberies and benches. Two men in their forties, also apparently\\nsanatorium patients, were raking up leaves that had fallen in the\\npathways. The women walked over to say good morning to the pair,\\nand Reiko made them laugh with another of her jokes. Cosmos were\\nblooming in the flowerbeds, and the shrubberies were extremely well\\nmanicured. Spotting Reiko, the birds started chattering and flying\\nabout inside the cage. The women entered the shed by the cage and came out with a bag of feed and a garden hose. Naoko screwed the hose to a tap and turned\\non the water. Taking care to prevent any birds from flying out, the two\\nof them slipped into the cage, Naoko hosing down the dirt and Reiko\\nscrubbing the floor of the cage with a deck brush. The spray sparkled\\nin the glare of the morning sun. The peacocks flapped around the cage\\nto avoid getting splashed. A turkey raised its head and glowered at me\\nlike a crotchety old man, while a parrot on the perch above screeched\\nits displeasure and beat its wings. Reiko meowed at the parrot, which\\nslunk over to the far corner but soon was calling: \"Thank you!\"\\n\"Crazy!\" \"Shithead!\" \"I wonder who taught him \\nthat\\n kind of language?\" said Naoko with a\\nsigh. \"Not me,\"\\n said Reiko. \"I would never do such a thing.\" She started\\nmeowing again, and the parrot shut up. Laughing, Reiko explained, \"This guy once had a run-in with a cat.\\nNow he\\'s scared to death of them.\" When they had finished cleaning, the two set down their tools and\\nwent around filling each of the feeders. Splashing its way through\\npuddles on the floor, the turkey darted to its feed box and plunged its\\nhead in, too obsessed with eating to be bothered by Naoko\\'s smacks\\non its tail. \"Do you do this every morning?\" I asked Naoko. \"Every morning!\" she said. \"They usually give this job to new women.\\nIt\\'s so easy. Like to see the rabbits?\" \"Sure,\" I said. The rabbit hutch was behind the aviary. Some ten\\nrabbits lay inside, asleep in the straw. Naoko swept up their droppings,\\nput feed in their box, and picked up one of the babies, nibbing it\\nagainst her cheek. \"Isn\\'t it precious?\" she gushed. She let me hold it. The warm, little ball\\nof fur cringed in my arms, twitching its nose. \"Don\\'t worry, he won\\'t hurt you,\" she said to the rabbit, stroking its\\nhead with her finger and smiling at me. It was such a radiant smile. without a trace of shadow, that I couldn’t help smiling myself. And\\nwhat about Naoko last night? I wondered. I knew for certain that it\\nhad been the real Naoko and not a dream: she had definitely taken her\\nclothes off and shown her naked body to me. Reiko whistled a lovely rendition of \"Proud Mary\" as she stuffed a\\nplastic bag with the debris they had gathered and tied the opening. I\\nhelped them carry the tools and feed bag to the shed. \"Morning is my favourite time of day,\" said Naoko. \"It\\'s like\\neverything\\'s starting out fresh and new. I begin to get sad around noon\\ntime, and I hate it when the sun goes down. I live with those same\\nfeelings clay aster day. \"And while you\\'re living with those feelings, you youngsters get old\\njust like me,\" said Reiko with a smile. \"You\\'re thinking about how it\\'s\\nmorning now or night and the next thing you know, you\\'re old.\" \"But you \\nlike\\n getting old,\" said Naoko. \"Not really,\" said Reiko. \"But I sure don\\'t wish I was young again.\"\\n\"Why not?\" I asked. \"Because it\\'s such a pain in the neck!\" she said. Then she tossed her\\nbroom in and closed the door of the shed, whistling \"Proud Mary\" all\\nthe while. Back at the flat, the women changed their boots for tennis shoes and\\nsaid they were going to the farm. Reiko suggested I stayed behind\\nwith a book or something because the work would be no fun to watch\\nand they would be doing it as part of a group. \"And while you\\'re\\nwaiting you can wash the pile of dirty underwear we left by the sink,\"\\nshe added. \"You\\'re kidding,\" I said, taken aback. \"Of course I am,\" she laughed. \"You\\'re so sweet. Isn’t he, Naoko?\" \"He really is,\" said Naoko, laughing with her. \"I\\'ll work on my German,\" I said with a sigh. \"Yeah, do your homework like a good boy,\" said Reiko. \"We\\'ll be back before lunch.\" The two of them went out tittering. I heard the footsteps and voices of\\na number of people walking by downstairs. I went into the bathroom and washed my face again, then borrowed a\\nnail clipper and trimmed my nails. For a bathroom that was being\\nshared by two women, its contents were incredibly simple. Aside from\\nsome neatly arranged bottles of cleansing cream and lip moisturizer and sun block, there was\\nalmost nothing that could be called cosmetics. When I finished\\ntrimming my nails, I made myself some coffee and drank it at the\\nkitchen table, German book open. Stripping down to a T-shirt in the\\nsun-filled kitchen, I had set about memorizing all the forms in a\\ngrammar chart when I was struck by an odd feeling. It seemed to me\\nthat the longest imaginable distance separated irregular German verb\\nforms from this kitchen table. The two women came back from the farm at 11.30, took turns in the\\nshower, and changed into fresh clothes. The three of us went to the\\ndining hall for lunch, then walked to the front gate. This time the\\nguardhouse had a man on duty. He was sitting at his desk, enjoying a\\nlunch that must have been brought to him from the dining hall. The\\ntransistor radio on the shelf was playing a sentimental old pop tune.\\nHe waved to us with a friendly \"Hi\" as we approached, and we\\nhello\\'ed him back. Reiko explained to him that we were going to walk outside the\\ngrounds and return in three hours. \"Great,\" he said. \"You\\'re lucky with the weather. Just stay away from\\nthe valley road, though. It got washed out in that big rain. No problem\\nanywhere else.\" Reiko wrote her name and Naoko\\'s in a register along with the date\\nand time. \"Enjoy yourselves,\" said the guard. \"And take care.\" \"Nice guy,\" I said. \"He\\'s a little strange up here,\" said Reiko, touching her head. He had been right about the weather, though. The sky was a fresh-\\nswept blue, with only a trace of white cloud clinging to the dome of\\nheaven like a thin streak of test paint. We walked beside the low stone\\nwall of Ami Hostel for a time, then moved away to climb a steep,\\nnarrow trail in single file. Reiko led the way, with Naoko in the\\nmiddle and me bringing up the rear. Reiko climbed with the confident\\nstride of one who knew every stretch of every mountain in the area.\\nWe concentrated on walking, with hardly a word among us. Naoko\\nwore blue jeans and a white blouse and carried her jacket in one hand.\\nI watched her long, straight hair swaying right and left where it met\\nher shoulders. She would glance back at me now and then, smiling\\nwhen our eyes met. The trail continued upwards so far that it was\\nalmost dizzying, but Reiko\\'s pace never slackened. Naoko hurried to\\nkeep up with her, wiping the sweat from her face. Not having indulged\\nin such outdoor activities for some time, I found myself running short\\nof breath. \"Do you do this a lot?\" I asked Naoko. \"Maybe once a week,\" she answered. \"Having a tough time?\" \"Kind of,\" I said. \"We\\'re almost there,\" said Reiko. \"This is about two-thirds of the way.\\nCome on, you\\'re a boy, aren\\'t you?\" \"Yeah, but I\\'m out of shape.\"\\n\"Playing with girls all the time,\" muttered Naoko, as if to herself. I wanted to answer her, but I was too winded to speak. Every now and\\nthen, red birds with tufts on their heads would flit across our path,\\nbrilliant against the blue sky. The fields around us were filled with\\nwhite and blue and yellow flowers, and bees buzzed everywhere.\\nMoving ahead one step at a time, I thought of nothing but the scene\\npassing before my eyes. The slope gave out after another ten minutes, and we gained a level plateau. We rested there, wiping the sweat off, catching our breath and drinking from our water bottles. Reiko found a leaf and used it to make a whistle. The trail entered a gentle downward slope amid tall, waving thickets\\nof plume grass. We walked on for some 15 minutes before passing\\nthrough a village. There were no signs of humanity here, and the\\ndozen or so houses were all in varying states of decay. Waist-high\\ngrass grew among the houses, and dry, white gobs of pigeon\\ndroppings clung to holes in the walls. Only the pillars survived in the\\ncase of one collapsed building, while others looked ready to be lived\\nin as soon as you opened the storm shutters. These dead, silent houses\\npressed against either side of the road as we slipped through. \"People lived in this village until seven or eight years ago,\" Reiko\\ninformed me. \"This was farmland around here. But they all cleared\\nout. Life was just too hard. They\\'d be trapped when the snow piled up\\nin the winter. And the soil isn\\'t particularly fertile. They could make a\\nbetter living in the city.\" \"What a waste,\" I said. \"Some of the houses look perfectly usable.\"\\n\"Some hippies tried living here at one point, but they gave up.\\nCouldn\\'t take the winters.\" A little beyond the village we came to a big fenced area that seemed to\\nbe a pasture. Far away on the other side, I caught sight of a few horses\\ngrazing. We followed the fence line, and a big dog came running over\\nto us, tail wagging. It stood up leaning on Reiko, sniffing her face,\\nthen jumped playfully on Naoko. I whistled and it came over to me,\\nlicking my hand with its long tongue. Naoko patted the dog\\'s head and explained that the animal belonged to\\nthe pasture. \"I\\'ll bet he\\'s close to 20,\" she said. \"His teeth are so bad,\\nhe can\\'t eat anything hard. He sleeps in front of the shop all day, and\\nhe comes running when he hears footsteps.\" Reiko took a scrap of cheese from her rucksack. Catching its scent, the\\ndog bounded over to her and chomped down on it. \"We won\\'t be able to see this fellow much longer,\" said Reiko, patting\\nthe dog\\'s head. \"In the middle of October they put the horses and cows in tracks and take \\'em down to the bam. The only time they let \\'em\\ngraze is the summer, when they open a little cafe kind of thing for the\\ntourists. The \"tourists\\'! Maybe 20 hikers in a day. Hey, how about\\nsomething to drink?\" \"Good idea,\" I said. The dog led the way to the cafe, a small, white house with a front\\nporch and a faded sign in the shape of a coffee cup hanging from the\\neaves. He led us up the steps and stretched out on the porch,\\nnarrowing his eyes. When we took our places around a table on the\\nporch, a girl with a ponytail and wearing a sweatshirt and white jeans\\ncame out and greeted Reiko and Naoko like old friends. \"This is a friend of Naoko\\'s,\" said Reiko, introducing me. \"Hi,\" she\\nsaid. \"Hi,\" I answered. While the three women traded small talk, I stroked the neck of the dog\\nunder the table. It had the hard, stringy neck of an old dog. When I\\nscratched the lumpy spots, the dog closed his eyes and sighed with\\npleasure. \"What\\'s his name?\" I asked the girl. \"Pepe,\" she said. \"Hey, Pepe,\" I said to the dog, but he didn’t budge. \"He\\'s hard of hearing,\" said the girl. \"You have to speak up or he can\\'t\\nhear.\" \"Pepe!\" I shouted. The dog opened his eyes and snapped t> attention\\nwith a bark. \"Never mind, Pepe,\" said the girl. \"Sleep more and live longer.\" Pepe\\nflopped down again at my feet. Naoko and Reiko ordered cold glasses of milk and I asked for a beer.\\n\"Let\\'s hear the radio,\" said Reiko. The girl switched on an anplifier\\nand tuned into an FM station. Blood, Sweat and Tears came on with\\n\"Spinning Wheel\". Reiko looked pleased. \"Now \\nthis\\n is what we\\'re here for! We don’t have radios in our rooms, so if I don\\'t come here once in a while, I don\\'t\\nhave any idea what\\'s playing out there.\" \"Do you sleep in this place?\" I asked the girl. \"No way!\" she laughed. \"I\\'d die of loneliness if I spent the night here.\\nThe pasture guy drives me into town and I come out again in the\\nmorning.\" She pointed at a four-wheel drive track parked in front of\\nthe nearby pasture office. \"You\\'ve got a holiday coming up soon, too, right?\" asked Reiko. \"Yeah, we\\'ll be shutting up this place soon,\" said the girl. Reiko\\noffered her a cigarette, and they smoked. \"I\\'ll miss you,\" said Reiko. \"I\\'ll be back in May, though,\" said the girl with a laugh. Cream came on the radio with \"White Room\". After a commercial, it\\nwas Simon and Garfunkel\\'s \"Scarborough Fair\". \"I like\\n that,\" said Reiko when it was over. \"I saw the film,\" I said. \"Who’s in it?\" \"Dustin Hoffman.\" \"I don’t know him,\" she said with a sad little shake of the head. \"The\\nworld changes like mad, and I don\\'t know what\\'s happening.\" She\\nasked the girl for a guitar. \"Sure,\" said the girl, switching off the radio\\nand bringing out an old guitar. The dog raised its head and sniffed the\\ninstrument. \"You can\\'t eat this,\" Reiko said with mock sternness. A grass-scented\\nbreeze swept over the porch. The mountains lay spread out before us,\\nthe ridge line sharp against the sky. \"It\\'s like a scene from \\nThe Sound of Music,\" I\\n said to Reiko as she\\ntuned up. \"What\\'s that?\" she asked. She strummed the guitar in search of the opening chord of\\n\"Scarborough Fair\". This was apparently her first attempt at the song,\\nbut after a few false starts she could play it through without hesitating. She had it down pat the third time and even started adding a few\\nflourishes. \"Good ear,\" she said to me with a wink. \"I can usually play\\njust about anything if I hear it three times.\" Softly humming the melody, she did a full rendition of \"Scarborough\\nFair\". The three of us applauded, and Reiko responded with a\\ndecorous bow of the head. \"I used to get more applause for a Mozart concerto,\" she said. Her milk was on the house if she would play the Beatles\\' \"Here Comes\\nthe Sun\", said the girl. Reiko gave her a thumbs up and launched into\\nthe song. Hers was not a full voice, and too much smoking had given\\nit a husky edge, but it was lovely, with real presence. I almost felt as if\\nthe sun really was coming up again as I sat there listening and\\ndrinking beer and looking at the mountains. It was a soft, warm\\nfeeling. Reiko gave back the guitar and asked to hear the radio again. Then she\\nsuggested to Naoko and me that we take an hour and walk around the\\narea. \"I want to listen to the radio some more and hang out\\nwith her. If you come back by three, that should be OK.\" \"Is it all right for us to be alone together so long?\" \"Well, actually, it\\'s against the rules, but what the hell. I\\'m not a\\nchaperone, after all. I could use a break. And you came all the way\\nfrom Tokyo, I\\'m sure there\\'s tons of stuff you want to talk about.\"\\nReiko lit another cigarette as she spoke. \"Let\\'s go,\" said Naoko, standing up. I started after her. The dog woke up and followed us for a while, but it\\nsoon lost interest and went back to its place on the porch. We strolled\\ndown a level road that followed the pasture fence. Naoko would take\\nmy hand every now and then or slip her arm under mine. \"This is kind of like the old days, isn\\'t it?\" she said. \"That wasn\\'t \\'the old days\\',\" I laughed. \"It was spring of this year! If\\nthat was \\'the old days\\', ten years ago was ancient history.\" \"It feels like ancient history,\" said Naoko. \"But anyway, sorry about\\nlast night. I don\\'t know, I was a bundle of nerves. I really shouldn\\'t\\nhave done that after you came here all the way from Tokyo.\" \"Never mind,\" I said. \"Both of us have a lot of feelings we need to get\\nout in the open. So if you want to take those feelings and smash\\nsomebody with them, smash me. Then we can understand each other\\nbetter.\" \"So if you understand me better, what then?\" \"You don’t get it, do you?\" I said. \"It’s not a question of what then’.\\nSome people get a kick out of reading railway timetables and that’s all\\nthey do all day. Some people make huge model boats out of\\nmatchsticks. So what’s wrong if there happens to be one guy in the\\nworld who enjoys trying to understand you?\" \"Kind of like a hobby?\" she said, amused. \"Yeah, I guess you could call it a hobby. Most normal people would\\ncall it friendship or love or something, but if you want to call it a\\nhobby, that\\'s OK, too.\" \"Tell me,\" said Naoko, \"you liked Kizuki, too, didn\\'t you?\" \"Of\\ncourse,\" I said. \"How about Reiko?\" \"I like her a lot,\" I said. \"She’s really nice.\" \"How come you always like people like that - people like us, I mean?\\nWe’re all kind of weird and twisted and drowning - me and Kizuki and\\nReiko. Why can’t you like more normal people?\" \"Because I don’t see you like that,\" I said after giving it some thought.\\n\"I don\\'t see you or Kizuki or Reiko as \"twisted\\' in any way. The guys I\\nthink of as twisted are out there running around.\" \"But we \\nare\\n twisted,\" said Naoko. \\n\"I\\n can see that.\" We walked on in silence. The road left the fence and came out to a\\ncircular grassy field ringed with trees like a pond. \"Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night so scared,\" said\\nNaoko, pressing up against my arm. \"I’m scared I\\'ll never get better again. I\\'ll always stay twisted like this and grow old and waste away\\nhere. I get so chilled it\\'s like I\\'m all frozen inside. It\\'s horrible ... so\\ncold. .. \" I put my arm around her and drew her close. \"I feel like Kizuki is reaching out for me from the darkness, calling to me, \"Hey, Naoko, we can\\'t stay apart.\\' When I hear him saying that, I don\\'t know what to do.\" \"What do you do?\" \"Well... don\\'t take this the wrong way, now.\" \"OK, I won\\'t.\" \"I ask Reiko to hold me. I wake her up and crawl into her bed and let\\nher hold me tight. And I cry. And she strokes me until the ice melts\\nand I\\'m warm again. Do you think it\\'s sick?\" \"No. I wish I could be the one to hold you, though,\" I said. \"So hold me. Now. Right here.\" We sat down on the diy grass of the meadow and put our arms around\\neach other. The tall grass surrounded us, and we could see nothing but\\nthe sky and clouds above. I gently lay Naoko down and took her in my\\narms. She was soft and warm and her hands reached out for me. We\\nkissed with real feeling. \"Tell me something, Tom,\" Naoko whispered in my ear. \"What\\'s that?\" I asked. \"Do you want to sleep with me?\" \"Of course I do,\" I said. \"Can you wait?\" \"Of course I can.\" \"Before we do it again, I want to get myself a little better. I want to\\nmake myself into a person more worthy of that hobby of yours. Will\\nyou wait for me to do that?\" \"Of course I\\'ll wait.\" \"Are you hard now?\" \"You mean the soles of my feet?\" \"Silly,\" Naoko tittered. \"If you\\'re asking whether I have an erection, of course I do.\" \"Will\\nyou do me a favour and stop saying \"Of course\\'?\" \"OK, I\\'ll stop.\" \"Is it difficult?\" \"What?\" \"To be all hard like that.\" \"Difficult?\" \"I mean, are you suffering?\" \"Well, it depends how you look at it.\" \"Want me to help you get rid of it?\" \"With your hand?\" \"Uh-huh. To tell you the truth,\" said Naoko, \"it\\'s been sticking into me\\never since we lay down. It hurts.\" I pulled my hips away. \"Better?\"\\n\"Thanks.\" \"You know?\" I said. \"What?\" \"I wish you would do it.\" \"OK,\" she said with a kind smile. Then she unzipped my trousers and\\ntook my stiff penis in her hand. \"It\\'s warm,\" she said. She started to move her hand, but I stopped her and unbuttoned her\\nblouse, reaching around to undo her bra strap. I kissed her soft, pink\\nnipples. She closed her eyes and slowly started moving her fingers.\\n\"Hey, you\\'re pretty good at that,\" I said. \"Be a good boy and shut up,\"\\nsaid Naoko. After I came, I held her in my arms and kissed her again. Naoko did\\nup her bra and blouse, and I zipped up my flies. \"Will that make it easier for you to walk?\" she asked. \"I owe it all to you.\" \"Well, then. Sir, if it suits you, shall we walk a little farther?\" \"By all means.\" We cut across the meadow, through a stand of trees, and across\\nanother meadow. Naoko talked about her dead sister, explaining that\\nalthough she had hardly said anything about this to anyone, she felt\\nshe ought to tell me. \"She was six years older than me, and our personalities were \\ntotally\\ndifferent, but still we were very close. We never fought, not once. It\\'s\\ntrue. Of course, with such a big difference in our ages, there was\\nnothing much for us to fight about.\" Her sister was one of those girls who are successful at every thing - a super-student, a super-athlete, popular, a leader, kind,\\nstraightforward, the boys liked her, her teachers loved her, her walls\\nwere covered with certificates of merit. There\\'s always one girl like\\nthat in any school. \"I\\'m not saying this because she\\'s my sister, but she\\nnever let any of this spoil her or make her the least bit stuck-up or a\\nshow-off. It\\'s just that, no matter what you gave her to do, she would\\nnaturally do it better than anyone else. \"So when I was little, I decided that I was going to be the sweet little\\ngirl.\" Naoko twirled a frond of plume grass as she spoke. \"I mean, you\\nknow, I grew up hearing everybody talking about how smart she was\\nand how good she was at games and how popular she was. Of course\\nI\\'m going to assume there\\'s no way I could ever compete with her. My\\nface, at least, was a little prettier than hers, so I guess my parents\\ndecided they\\'d bring me up cute. Right from the start they put me in\\nthat\\n kind of school. They dressed me in velvet dresses and frilly\\nblouses and patent leather shoes and gave me piano lessons and ballet\\nlessons. This just made my sister even crazier about me - you know: I\\nwas her cute little sister. She\\'d give me these cute little presents and\\ntake me everywhere with her and help me with my homework. She\\neven took me along on dates. She was the best big sister anyone could\\nask for. \"Nobody knew why she killed herself. The same as Kizuki. Exactly\\nthe same. She was 17, too, and she never gave the slightest hint she\\nwas going to commit suicide. She didn’t leave a note, either. Really, it\\nwas exactly the same, don\\'t you think?\" \"Sounds like it.\" \"Everybody said she was too smart or she read too many books. And\\nshe \\ndid\\n read a lot. She had tons of books. I read a bunch of them after\\nshe died, and it was so sad. They had her comments in the margins\\nand flowers pressed between the pages and letters from boyfriends,\\nand every time I came across something like that I\\'d cry. I cried a lot.\"\\nNaoko fell silent for a few seconds, twirling the plume grass again. \"She was the kind of person who took care of things by herself. She\\'d\\nnever ask anybody for advice or help. It wasn\\'t a matter of pride, I\\nthink. She just did what seemed natural to her. My parents were used\\nto this and thought she\\'d be OK if they left her alone. I would go to\\nmy sister for advice and she was always ready to give it, but she never\\nwent to anyone else. She did what needed to be done, on her own. She\\nnever got angry or moody. This is all true, I mean it. I\\'m not\\nexaggerating. Most girls, when they have their period or something,\\nwill get grumpy and take it out on others, but she never even did that.\\nInstead of getting into a bad mood, she would become very subdued.\\nMaybe once in two or three months this would happen to her: she\\'d\\nshut herself up in her room and stay in bed, avoid school, hardly eat a\\nthing, turn the lights off, and space out. She wouldn\\'t be in a bad\\nmood, though. When I came home from school, she’d call me into her\\nroom and sit me down next to her and ask me about my day. I\\'d tell\\nher all the little things - like what kinds of games I played with my\\nfriends or what the teacher said or my exam results, stuff like that.\\nShe\\'d take in every detail and make comments and suggestions, but as\\nsoon as I left - to play with a friend, say, or go to a ballet lesson - she\\'d\\nspace out again. After two days, she\\'d snap out of it just like that and\\ngo to school. This kind of thing went on for, I don\\'t know, maybe\\nfour years. My parents were worried at first and I think they went to a\\ndoctor for advice, but, I mean, she\\'d be perfectly fine after two days,\\nso they thought it would work itself out if they left her alone, she was\\nsuch a bright, steady girl. \"After she died, though, I heard my parents talking about a younger\\nbrother of my father\\'s who had died long before. He had also been\\nvery bright, but he had stayed shut up in the house for \\nfour years -\\nfrom the time he was 17 until he was 21. And then suddenly one day\\nhe left the house and jumped in front of a train. My father said,\\n\"Maybe it\\'s in the blood - from my side\\'.\" While Naoko was speaking, her fingers unconsciously teased the\\ntassel of the plume grass, scattering its fibres to the wind. When the\\nshaft was bare, she wound it around her fingers. \"I was the one who found my sister dead,\" she went on. \"In autumn\\nwhen I was in the first year. November. On a dark, rainy day. My\\nsister was in the sixth-form at the time. I came home from my piano\\nlesson at 6.30 and my mother was making dinner. She told me to tell\\nmy sister it was ready. I went upstairs and knocked on her door and\\nyelled \"Dinner\\'s ready\\', but there was no answer. Her room was\\ncompletely silent. I thought this was strange, so I knocked again,\\nopened the door and peeped inside. I thought she was probably\\nsleeping. She wasn\\'t in bed, though. She was standing by the window,\\nstaring outside, with her neck bent at a kind of angle like this, like she\\nwas thinking. The room was dark, the lights were out, and it was hard\\nto see anything. \"What are you doing?\\' I said to her. \"Dinner is ready.\\'\\nThat\\'s when I noticed that she looked taller than usual. What was\\ngoing on? I wondered: it was so strange! Did she have high heels on?\\nWas she standing on something? I moved closer and was just about to\\nspeak to her again when I saw it: there was a rope above her head. It\\ncame straight down from a beam in the ceiling - I mean it was\\namazingly straight, like somebody had drawn a line in space with a\\nruler. My sister had a white blouse on - yeah, a simple white blouse\\nlike this one - and a grey skirt, and her toes were pointing down like a\\nballerina\\'s, except there was a space between the tip of her toes and\\nthe floor of maybe seven or eight inches. I took in every detail. Her\\nface, too. I looked at her face. I couldn’t help it. I thought: I\\'ve got to\\ngo right downstairs and tell my mother. I\\'ve got to scream. But my\\nbody ignored me. It moved on its own, separately from my conscious\\nmind. It was trying to lower her from the rope while my mind was\\ntelling me to hurry downstairs. Of course, there was no way a little\\ngirl could have the strength to do such a thing, and so I just stood\\nthere, spacing out, for maybe five or six minutes, a total blank, like something inside me had died. I just stayed that way, with my sister,\\nin that cold, dark place until my mother came up to see what was\\ngoing on.\" Naoko shook her head. \"For three days after that I couldn\\'t talk. I just lay in bed like a dead\\nperson, eyes wide open and staring into space. I didn\\'t know what was\\nhappening.\" Naoko pressed against my arm. \"I told you in my letter,\\ndidn\\'t I? I\\'m a far more flawed human being than you realize. My\\nsickness is a lot worse than you think: it has far deeper roots. And\\nthat\\'s why I want you to go on ahead of me if you can. Don\\'t wait for\\nme. Sleep with other girls if you want to. Don\\'t let thoughts of me hold\\nyou back. Just do what you want to do. Otherwise, I might end up\\ntaking you with me, and that is the one thing I don\\'t want to do. I don\\'t\\nwant to interfere with your life. I don\\'t want to interfere with\\nanybody\\'s life. Like I said before, I want you to come to see me every\\nonce in a while, and always remember me. That\\'s all I want.\" \"It\\'s \\nnot\\n all / want, though,\" I said. \"You\\'re wasting your life being involved with me.\" \"I\\'m not wasting\\nanything.\" \"But I might never recover. Will you wait for me forever? Can you wait 10 years, 20 years?\" \"You\\'re letting yourself be scared by too many things,\" I said. \"The\\ndark, bad dreams, the power of the dead. You have to forget them. I\\'m\\nsure you\\'ll get well if you do.\" \"If I can,\" said Naoko, shaking her head. \"If you can get out of this place, will you live with me?\" I asked.\\n\"Then I can protect you from the dark and from bad dreams. Then\\nyou\\'d have me instead of Reiko to hold you when things got difficult.\"\\nNaoko pressed still more firmly against me. \"That would be\\nwonderful,\" she said. We got back to the cafe a little before three. Reiko was reading a book and listening to Brahms\\' Second Piano Concerto on the radio. There\\nwas something wonderful about Brahms playing at the edge of a\\ngrassy meadow without a sign of anyone as far as the eye could see.\\nReiko was whistling along with the cello passage that begins the third\\nmovement. \"Backhaus and Bohm,\" she said. \"I wore this record out once, a long\\ntime ago. Literally. I wore the grooves out listening to every note. I\\nsucked the music right out of it.\" Naoko and I ordered coffee. \"Do a lot of talking?\" asked Reiko. \"Tons,\" said Naoko. \"Tell me all about his, uh, you know, later.\" \"We didn\\'t do any of that,\" said Naoko, reddening. \"Really?\" Reiko\\nasked me. \"Nothing?\" \"Nothing,\" I said. \"Bo-o-o-ring!\" she said with a bored look on her face. \"True,\" I said,\\nsipping my coffee. The scene in the dining hall was the same as the day before - the\\nmood, the voices, the faces. Only the menu had changed. The balding\\nman in white, who yesterday had been talking about the secretion of\\ngastric juices under weightless conditions, joined the three of us at our\\ntable and talked for a long time about the correlation of brain size to\\nintelligence. As we ate our soybean burgers, we heard all about the\\nvolume of Bismarck\\'s brain and Napoleon\\'s. He pushed his plate aside\\nand used a ballpoint pen and notepaper to draw sketches of brains. He\\nwould start to draw, declare \"No, that\\'s not quite it\", and begin a new\\none. This happened several times. When he had finished, he carefully\\nput the remaining notepaper away in a pocket of his white jacket and\\nslipped the pen into his breast pocket, in which he kept a total of three\\npens, along with pencils and a ruler. Having finished his meal, he\\nrepeated what he had told me the day before, \"The winters here are\\nreally nice. Make sure you come back when it\\'s winter,\" and left the dining hall. \"Is he a doctor or a patient?\" I asked Reiko. \"Which do you think?\" \"I really can\\'t tell. In either case, he doesn\\'t seem all that normal.\" \"He’s a doctor,\" said Naoko. \"Doctor Miyata.\" \"Yeah,\" said Reiko, \"but I bet he’s the craziest one here.\" \"Mr Omura, the gatekeeper, is pretty crazy, too,\" answered Naoko. \"True,\" said Reiko, nodding as she stabbed her broccoli. \"He does\\nthese wild callisthenics every morning, screaming nonsense at the top\\nof his lungs. And before you came, Naoko, there was a girl in the\\nbusiness office. Miss Kinoshita, who tried to kill herself. And last year\\nthey sacked a male nurse, Tokushima, who had a terrible drinking\\nproblem.\" \"Sounds like patients and staff should swap places,\" I said. \"Right on,\" said Reiko, waving her fork in the air. \"You’re finally\\nstarting to see how things work here.\" \"I suppose so.\" \"What makes us most normal,\" said Reiko, \"is knowing that we’re not\\nnormal.\" Back in the room, Naoko and I played cards while Reiko practised\\nBach on her guitar. \"What time are you leaving tomorrow?\" Reiko asked me, taking a\\nbreak and lighting a cigarette. \"Straight after breakfast,\" I said. \"The bus comes at nine. That way I\\ncan get back in time for tomorrow night\\'s work.\" \"Too bad. It\\'d be nice if you could stay longer.\" \"If I stayed around too long, I might end up living here,\" I said,\\nlaughing. \"Maybe so,\" Reiko said. Then, to Naoko, she said, \"Oh, yeah. I\\'ve got\\nto go get some grapes at Oka\\'s. I totally forgot.\" \"Want me to go with you?\" asked Naoko. \"How about letting me borrow your young Mr Watanabe here?\" \"Fine,\" said Naoko. \"Good. Let\\'s just the two of us go for another nighttime stroll,\" said\\nReiko, taking my hand. \"We Yesterday. Let\\'s go all the way tonight.\"\\n\"Fine,\" said Naoko, tittering. \"Do what you like.\"\\nwere almost there. The night air was cool. Reiko wore a pale blue cardigan over her shirt\\nand walked with her hands shoved in her jeans pockets. Looking up at\\nthe sky, she sniffed the breeze like a dog. \"Smells like rain,\" she said.\\nI tried sniffing too, but couldn’t smell anything. True, there were lots\\nof clouds in the sky obscuring the moon. \"If you stay here long enough, you can pretty much tell the weather by\\nthe smell of the air,\" said Reiko. We entered the wooded area where the staff houses stood. Reiko told\\nme to wait a minute, walked over to the front door of one house and\\nrang the bell. A woman came to the door - no doubt the lady of the\\nhouse - and stood there chatting and chuckling with Reiko. Then she\\nducked inside and came back with a large plastic bag. Reiko thanked\\nher and said goodnight before returning to the spot where I was\\nwaiting. \"Look,” she said, opening the bag. It held a huge cluster of grapes. \"Do you like grapes?\" \"Love them.\" She handed me the top bunch. \"It\\'s OK to eat them. They\\'re washed.\" We walked along eating grapes and spitting the skins and seeds on the\\nground. They were fresh and delicious. \"I give their son piano lessons once in a while, and they offer me\\ndifferent stuff. The wine we had was from them. I sometimes ask them\\nto do a little shopping for me in town.\" \"I\\'d like to hear the rest of the story you were telling me yesterday,\" I\\nsaid. \"Fine,\" said Reiko. \"But if we keep coming home late, Naoko might\\nstart getting suspicious.\" \"I\\'m willing to risk it.\" \"OK. then. I want a roof, though. It\\'s a little chilly tonight.\" She turned left as we approached the tennis courts. We went down a\\nnarrow stairway and came out at a spot where several storehouses\\nstood like a block of houses. Reiko opened the door of the nearest one,\\nstepped in and turned on the lights. \\n\"Come\\n in,\" she said. \"There\\'s not\\nmuch to see, though.\" The storehouse contained neat rows of cross-country skis, boots and\\npoles, and on the floor were piled snow removal equipment and bags\\nof rock salt. \"I used to come here all the time for guitar practice - when I wanted to\\nbe alone. Nice and cosy, isn’t it?\" Reiko sat on the bags of rock salt and invited me to sit next to her. I\\ndid as I was told. \"Not much ventilation here, but mind if I smoke?\" \"Go ahead,\" I said. \"This is one habit I can\\'t seem to break,\" she said with a frown, but\\nshe lit up with obvious enjoyment. Not many people enjoy tobacco as\\nmuch as Reiko did. I ate my grapes, carefully peeling them one at a\\ntime and tossing the skins and seeds into a tin that served as a rubbish\\nbin. \"Now, let\\'s see, how far did we get last night?\" Reiko asked. \"It was a dark and stormy night, and you were climbing the steep cliff\\nto grab the bird\\'s nest.\" \"You\\'re amazing, the way you can joke around with such a straight\\nface,\" said Reiko. \"Let\\'s see, I think I had got to the point where I was\\ngiving piano lessons to the girl every Saturday morning.\" \"That’s it.\" \"Assuming you can divide everybody in the world into two groups - those who are good at teaching things to people, and those who are not\\n-1 pretty much belong to the first group,\" said Reiko. \"I never thought\\nso when I was young, and I suppose I didn’t want to think of myself\\nthat way, but once I reached a certain age and had attained a degree of selfknowledge I\\nrealized it was true after all: I\\'m good at teaching people things. Really\\ngood.\" \"I bet you are.\" \"I have a lot more patience for others than I have for myself, and I\\'m\\nmuch better at bringing out the best in others than in myself. That\\'s\\njust the kind of person I am. I\\'m the scratchy stuff on the side of the\\nmatchbox. But that\\'s fine with me. I don’t mind at all. Better to be a\\nfirst-class matchbox than a second-class match. I got this clear in my\\nown mind. I’d say, after I started teaching this girl. I had taught a few\\nothers when I was younger, strictly as a sideline, without realizing this\\nabout myself. It was only after I started teaching her that I began to\\nthink of myself that way. Hey - I\\'m \\ngood\\n at teaching people. That\\'s\\nhow well the lessons went. As I said yesterday, the girl was nothing special when it came to\\ntechnique, and there was no question of her becoming a professional\\nmusician, so I could take it easy. Plus she was going to the kind of\\ngirls\\' school where anybody with halfdecent marks automatically got\\ninto university, which meant she didn\\'t have to kill herself studying,\\nand her mother was all for going easy with the lessons, too. So I didn’t\\npush her to do anything. I knew the first time I met her that she was\\nthe kind of girl you \\ncouldn\\'t\\n push to do anything, that she was the kind\\nof child who would be all sweetness and say \"Yes, yes,’ and \\nabsolutely\\nrefuse\\n to do anything she didn’t want to do. So the first thing I did was\\nlet her play a piece the way she wanted to - 100 per cent her own way.\\nThen I would play the same piece several different ways for her, and\\nthe two of us would discuss which was best or which way she liked most. Then I\\'d have her play the piece again, and her performance\\nwould be ten times better than the first. She would see for\\nherself what worked best and bring those features into her \\nown\\nplaying.\" Reiko paused for a moment, observing the glowing end of her\\ncigarette. I went on eating my grapes without a word. \"I know I have a pretty good sense for music, but she was better than\\nme. I used to think it was such a waste! I thought, ,if only she had started out with a good teacher and received the\\nproper training, she’d be so much farther along!\\' But I was wrong. She\\nwasn\\'t the kind of child who could stand proper training. There just\\nhappen to be people like that. They\\'re blessed with this marvellous\\ntalent, but they can\\'t make the effort to systematize it. They end up\\nsquandering it in little bits and pieces. I\\'ve seen my share of people\\nlike that. At first you think they\\'re amazing. They can sight-read some\\nterrifically difficult piece and do a damn good job playing it all the\\nway through. You see them do it, and you\\'re overwhelmed. You think,\\n\"I could never do that in a million years.\\' But that\\'s as far as it goes.\\nThey can\\'t take it any further. And why not? Because they won\\'t put in\\nthe effort. They haven\\'t had the discipline pounded into them. They\\'ve\\nbeen spoiled. They have just enough talent so they\\'ve been able to\\nplay things well without any effort and they\\'ve had people telling them\\nhow great they are from an early age, so hard work looks stupid to\\nthem. They\\'ll take some piece another kid has to work on for three\\nweeks and polish it off in half the time, so the teacher assumes they\\'ve\\nput enough into it and lets them go on to the next thing. And they do\\nthat\\n in half the time and go on to the \\nnext\\n piece. They never find out\\nwhat it means to be hammered by the teacher; they lose out on a\\ncrucial element required for character building. It\\'s a tragedy. I myself\\nhad tendencies like that, but fortunately I had a very tough teacher, so\\nI kept them in check. \"Anyway, it was a joy to teach her. Like driving down the highway in a high-powered sports car that responds to the slightest touch -\\nresponds too quickly, sometimes. The trick to teaching children like\\nthat is not to praise them too much. They\\'re so used to praise it doesn\\'t\\nmean anything to them. You\\'ve got to dole it out wisely. And you can\\'t\\nforce anything on them. You have to let them choose for themselves.\\nAnd you don\\'t let them rush ahead from one thing to the next: you\\nmake them stop and think. But that\\'s about it. If you do those things,\\nyou\\'ll get good results.\" Reiko dropped her cigarette butt on the floor and stamped it out. Then\\nshe took a deep breath as if to calm herself. \"When her lessons ended, we\\'d have tea and chat. Sometimes I’d show\\nher certain jazz piano styles - like, this is Bud Powell, or this is\\nThelonious Monk. But mostly she talked. And what a talker she was!\\nShe could draw you right in. As I told you yesterday, I think most of\\nwhat she said was made up, but it was \\ninteresting.\\n She was a keen\\nobserver, a precise user of language, sharp-tongued and funny. She\\ncould stir your emotions. Yes, really, that\\'s what she was so good at -\\nstirring people\\'s emotions, \\nmoving you.\\n And she \\nknew\\n she had this\\npower. She tried to use it as skilfully and effectively as possible. She\\ncould make you feel whatever she wanted - angry or sad or\\nsympathetic or disappointed or happy. She would manipulate people\\'s\\nemotions for no other reason than to test her own powers. Of course, I\\nonly realized this later. At the time, I had no idea what she was doing\\nto me.\" Reiko shook her head and ate a few grapes. \"It was a sickness,\" she said. \"The girl was sick. She was like the\\nrotten apple that ruins all the other apples. And no one could cure her.\\nShe\\'ll have that sickness until the day she dies. In that sense, she was a\\nsad little creature. I would have pitied her, too, if I hadn\\'t been one of her victims. I would have seen\\nher\\n as a victim.\" Reiko ate a few more grapes. She seemed to be thinking of how best to go on with her story. \"Well, anyway, I enjoyed teaching her for a good six months.\\nSometimes I\\'d find something she said a little surprising or odd. Or\\nshe\\'d be talking and I\\'d have this rash of horror when I realised the\\nintensity of her hatred for some person was completely irrational, or it\\nwould occur to me that she was just far too clever, and I\\'d wonder\\nwhat she was really thinking. But, after all, everyone has their flaws,\\nright? And finally, what business was it of mine to question her\\npersonality or character? I was just her piano teacher. All I had to care\\nabout was whether she practised or not. And besides, the truth of the\\nmatter is that I liked her. I liked her a lot. \"Still, I was careful not to tell her anything too personal about myself.\\nI just had this sixth sense that I’d better not talk about such things. She\\nasked me hundreds of questions - she was dying to know more about\\nme - but I only told her the most harmless stuff, like things about my\\nchildhood or where I’d gone to school, stuff like that. She said she\\nwanted to know more about me, but I told her there was nothing to\\ntell: I’d had a boring life, I had an ordinary husband, an ordinary child,\\nand a ton of housework. \"But I like you so \\nmuch,\\'\\n she’d say and look\\nme right in the eye in this clingy sort of way. It sent a thrill through\\nme when she did that - a \\nnice\\n thrill. But even so, I never told her more\\nthan I had to. \"And then one day - a day in May, I think it was - in the middle of her\\nlesson, she said she felt sick. I saw she was pale and sweating and\\nasked if she wanted to go home, but she said she thought she\\'d feel\\nbetter if she could just lie down for a while. So I took her - almost\\ncarried her - to the bedroom. We had such a small sofa, the bed was the only place she \\ncould\\n lie\\ndown. She apologized for being a nuisance, but I assured her it was no\\nbother and asked if she wanted anything to drink. She said no, she just\\nwanted me to stay near her, which I said I’d be glad to do. \"A few minutes later she asked me to rub her back. She sounded as though she was really suffering, and she was sweating like mad, so I\\nstarted to give her a good massage. Then she apologized and asked me\\nif I\\'d mind taking off her bra, as it was hurting her. So, I don\\'t know, I\\ndid it. She was wearing a skin-tight blouse, and I had to unbutton that\\nand reach behind and undo the bra hooks. She had big breasts for a\\n13-year-old. Twice as big as mine. And she wasn\\'t wearing any starter\\nbra but a real adult model, an expensive one. Of course I\\'m not paying\\nall that much attention at the time, and like an idiot I just carry on\\nrubbing her back. She keeps apologizing in this pitiful voice as if she\\'s\\nreally sorry, and I keep telling her it\\'s OK it\\'s OK.\" Reiko tapped the ash from her cigarette to the floor. By then I had\\nstopped eating grapes and was giving all my attention to her story. \"After a while she starts sobbing. \"What\\'s wrong?\\' I ask her.\\n\"Nothing,\\n1\\n she says. \"It\\'s obviously not nothing,’ I say. \"Tell me the\\ntruth. What\\'s bothering you?\\' So she says, \"I just get like this\\nsometimes. I don\\'t know what to do. I\\'m so lonely and sad, and I can\\'t\\ntalk to anybody, and nobody cares about me. And it hurts so much, I\\njust get like this. I can\\'t sleep at night, and I don\\'t feel like eating, and\\ncoming here for my lesson is the only thing I have to look forward to.\\'\\nSo I say, \"You can talk to me. Tell me why this happens to you.\\'\\nThings are not going well at home, she says. She can\\'t love her\\nparents, and they don\\'t love her. Her father is seeing another woman\\nand is hardly ever around, and that makes her mother half \\ncrazy\\n and\\nshe takes it out on the girl; she beats her almost every day and she\\nhates to go home. So now the girl is really wailing, and her eyes are\\nfull of tears, those beautiful eyes of hers. The sight is enough to make\\na god weep. So I tell her, if it\\'s so terrible to go home, she can come to\\nmy place any time she likes. When she hears that, the girl throws her\\narms around me and says, \"Oh, I\\'m so sorry, but if I didn’t have you I\\nwouldn\\'t know what to do. Please don’t turn your back on me. If you\\ndid that. I’d have nowhere to go.’ \"So, I don’t know, I hold her head against me and I’m caressing her and saying \"There there,\\' and she\\'s got her arms around me and she\\'s\\nstroking my back, and soon I\\'m starting to feel very strange, my whole\\nbody is kind of hot. I mean, here\\'s this picture-perfect beautiful girl\\nand I\\'m on the bed with her, and we\\'re hugging, and her hands are\\ncaressing my back in this incredibly sensual way that my own\\nhusband couldn\\'t even begin to match, and I feel all the screws coming\\nloose in my body every time she touches me, and before I know it she\\nhas my blouse and bra off and she’s stroking my breasts. So that’s\\nwhen it finally hits me that she’s an absolute dyed-in-the-wool lesbian.\\nThis had happened to me once before, at school, one of the sixth-form\\ngirls. So then I tell her to stop. \"\"Oh, please,’ she says, \"just a little more. I\\'m so lonely. I\\'m so lonely,\\nplease believe me, you\\'re the only one I have, oh please, don\\'t turn\\nyour back on me,\\' and she takes my hand and puts it on her breast -\\nher very nicely shaped breast, and, sure. I\\'m a woman, but this electric\\nsomething goes through me when my hand makes contact. I have no\\nidea what to do. I just keep repeating no no no no no, like an idiot. It\\'s\\nas if I\\'m Paralyzed, I can\\'t move. I had managed to push the girl\\naway at school, but now I can\\'t do a thing. My body won\\'t take orders.\\nShe\\'s holding my right hand against her with her left hand, and she\\'s\\nkissing and licking my nipples, and her right hand is caressing my\\nback, my side, my bottom. So here I am in the bedroom with the\\ncurtains closed and a 13-year-old girl has me practically naked - she\\'s\\nbeen taking my clothes off somehow all along - and touching me all\\nover and I\\'m writhing with the pleasure of it. Looking back on it now,\\nit seems incredible. I mean, it\\'s insane, don\\'t you think? But at the time\\nit was as if she had cast a spell on me.\" Reiko paused to puff at her cigarette. \"You know, this is the first time I\\'ve ever told a man about it,\" she\\nsaid, looking at me. \"I\\'m telling it to you because I think I ought to,\\nbut I\\'m finding it really embarrassing.\" \"I\\'m sorry,\" I said, because I didn\\'t know what else to say. \"This went on for a while, and then her right hand started to move\\ndown, and she touched me through my panties. By then, I was\\nabsolutely soaking wet. I\\'m ashamed to say it, but I\\'ve never been so\\nwet before or since. I had always thought of myself as sort of\\nindifferent to sex, so I was astounded to be getting so worked up. So\\nthen she puts these slim, soft fingers of hers inside my panties, and ...\\nwell, you know, I can\\'t bring myself to put it into words. I mean, it\\nwas totally different from when a man puts his clumsy hands on you\\nthere. It was amazing. Really. Like feathers or down. I thought all the\\nfuses in my head were going to pop. Still, somewhere in my fogged-\\nover brain, the thought occurred to me that I had to put a stop to this.\\nIf I let it happen once. I\\'d never stop, and if I had to carry around a\\nsecret like that inside me, my head was going to get completely\\nmessed up again. I thought about my daughter, too. What if she saw\\nme like this? She was supposed to be at my parents\\' house until three\\non Saturdays, but what if something happened and she came home\\nunexpectedly ? This helped me to gather my strength and raise myself\\non the bed. \"Stop it now, please stop!\\' I shouted. \"But she wouldn\\'t stop. Instead, she yanked my panties down and\\nstarted using her tongue. I had rarely let even my husband do that, I\\nfound it so embarrassing, but now I had a 13-year-old girl licking me\\nall over down there. I just gave up. All I could do was cry. And it was\\nabsolute paradise. \"\"Stop it!’ I yelled one more time and slapped her on the side of the\\nface as hard as I could. She finally stopped, raised herself up and\\nlooked into my eyes. The two of us were stark naked, on our knees, in\\nbed, staring at each other. She was 13, I was 31, but, I don’t know,\\nlooking at that body of hers, I felt totally overwhelmed. The image is\\nstill so vivid in my mind. I could hardly believe I was looking at the\\nbody of a 13-year-old girl, and I still can’t believe it. By comparison,\\nwhat I had for a body was enough to make you cry. Believe me.\" There was nothing I could say, and so I said nothing. \"\"What\\'s wrong?\\' she says to me. \"You like it this way, don’t you? I\\nknew you would the first time I met you. I know you like it. It\\'s much\\nbetter than doing it with a man - isn’t it? Look how wet you are. I can\\nmake you feel even better if you\\'ll let me. It\\'s true. I can make you feel\\nlike your body\\'s melting away. You want me to, don\\'t you?\\' And she\\nwas right. She was much better than my husband. And \\nI did\\n want her\\nto do it even more! But I couldn’t let it happen. \"Let\\'s do this once a\\nweek,\\' she said. \"Just once a week. Nobody will find out. It\\'ll be our\\nlittle secret\\'.\" \"But I got out of bed and put on my dressing-gown and told her to\\nleave and never come back. She just looked at me. Her eyes were\\nabsolutely flat. I had never seen them like that before. It was as if they were painted on cardboard. They had no\\ndepth. After she stared at me for a while, she gathered up her clothes\\nwithout a word and. as slowly as she could, as though she were\\nmaking a show of it, she put on each item, one at a time. Then she\\nwent back into the piano room and took a brush from her bag. She\\nbrushed her hair and wiped the blood from her lips with a\\nhandkerchief, put on her shoes, and left. As she went out, she said.\\n\"You’re a lesbian, you know. It’s true. You may try to hide it, but\\nyou\\'ll be a lesbian until the day you die\\'.\" \"Is it true?\" I asked. Reiko curved her lips and thought for a while. \"Well, it is and it isn\\'t. I\\ndefinitely felt better with her than with my husband. That\\'s a fact. I\\nhad a time there when I really agonized over the question. Maybe I\\nreally was a lesbian and just hadn\\'t noticed until then. But I don’t think\\nso any more. Which is not to say I don’t have the tendencies. I\\nprobably do have them. But I’m not a lesbian in the proper sense of the\\nterm. I never feel desire when I look at a woman. Know what I\\nmean?\" I nodded. \"Certain kinds of girls, though, do respond to me, and I can feel it\\nwhen that happens. Those are the only times it comes out in me. I can\\nhold Naoko in my arms, though, and feel nothing special. We go\\naround in the flat practically naked when the weather\\'s hot, and we\\ntake baths together, sometimes even sleep in the same bed, but\\nnothing happens. I don\\'t feel a thing. I can see that she has a beautiful\\nbody, but that\\'s all. Actually, Naoko and I played a game once. We\\nmade believe we were lesbians. Want to hear about it?\" \"Sure. Tell me.\" \"When I told her the story I just told you - we tell each\\nother everything, you know - Naoko tried an experiment. The two of\\nus got undressed and she tried caressing me, but it didn’t work at all. It\\njust tickled. I thought I was going to die laughing. Just thinking about\\nit makes me itchy. She was so clumsy! I\\'ll bet you\\'re glad to hear\\nthat.\" \"Yes I am, to tell the truth.\" \"Well, anyway, that\\'s about it,\" said Reiko, scratching near an\\neyebrow with the tip of her little finger. \"After the girl left my house, I\\nfound a chair and sat there spacing out for a while, wondering what to\\ndo. I could hear the dull beating of my heart from deep inside my\\nbody. My arms and legs seemed to weigh a ton, and my mouth felt as\\nthough I\\'d eaten a moth or something, it was so diy. But I dragged\\nmyself to the bathroom, knowing my daughter would be back soon. I\\nwanted to clean those places where the girl had touched and licked\\nme. I scrubbed myself with soap, over and over, but I couldn\\'t seem to\\nget rid of the slimy feeling she had left behind. I knew I was probably\\nimagining it, but that didn’t help. That night, I asked my husband to\\nmake love to me, almost as a way to get rid of the defilement. Of\\ncourse, I didn’t tell him anything -1 couldn\\'t. All I said to him was that\\nI wanted him to take it slow, to give it more time than usual. And he\\ndid. He concentrated on every little detail, he really took a long, long\\ntime, and the way I came that night, oh yes, it was like nothing I had ever experienced before, never once in all our married life. And why\\ndo you think that was? Because the touch of that girl\\'s fingers was still\\nthere in my body. That\\'s all it was. \"Oh, man, is this embarrassing! Look, I\\'m sweating! I can\\'t believe I\\'m\\nsaying these things - he \"made love\\' to me, I \"came\\'!\" Reiko smiled,\\nher lips curved again. \"But even this didn\\'t help. Two days went by,\\nthree, and her touch was still there. And her last words were echoing\\nand echoing in my head. \"She didn\\'t come to my house the following Saturday. My heart was\\npounding all day long while I waited, wondering what I would do if\\nshe showed up. I couldn’t concentrate on anything. She never did\\ncome, though. Of course. She was a proud little thing, and she had\\nfailed with me in the end. She didn’t come the next week, either, nor\\nthe week after that, and soon a month went by. I decided that I would\\nbe able to forget about what had happened when enough time lad\\npassed, but I couldn\\'t forget. When I was alone in the house, I would\\nfeel her presence and my nerves would be on edge. I couldn\\'t play the\\npiano, I couldn\\'t think, I couldn\\'t do anything during that first month.\\nAnd then one day I realized that something was wrong whenever I left\\nthe house. The neighbours were looking at me in a strange way. There\\nwas a new distance in their eyes. They were as polite as ever with\\ntheir greetings, but there was something different in their tone of voice\\nand in their behaviour towards me. The woman next door, who used to\\npay me an occasional visit, seemed to be avoiding me. I tried not to let\\nthese things bother me, though. Start noticing things like that, and\\nyou\\'ve got the first signs of illness. \"Then one day I had a visit from another housewife I was on friendly\\nterms with. We were the same age, and she was the daughter of a\\nfriend of my mother\\'s, and her child went to the same kindergarten as\\nmine, so we were fairly close. She just showed up one day and asked\\nme if I knew about a terrible rumour that was going around about me.\\n\"What kind of rumour?\\' I asked. \"I almost can\\'t say it, it\\'s so awful,\\' she said. \"Well, you\\'ve got this far, you have to tell me the rest.\\' \"Still she resisted telling me, but I finally got it all out of her. I mean,\\nher whole purpose in coming to see me was to tell me what she had\\nheard, so of course she was going to spit it out eventually. According\\nto her, people were saying that I was a card-carrying lesbian and had\\nbeen in and out of mental hospitals for it. They said that I had snipped\\nthe clothes off my piano pupil and tried to do things to her and when\\nshe had resisted I had slapped her so hard her face swelled up. They\\nhad turned the story on its head, of course, which was bad enough, but\\nwhat really shocked me was that people knew I had been hospitalized.\\n\"My friend said she was telling everyone that she had known me for\\never and that I was not like that, but the girl\\'s parents believed \\nher\\nversion and were spreading it around the neighbourhood. In addition,\\nthey had investigated my background and found that I had a history of\\nmental problems. \"The way my friend heard it, the girl had come home from her lesson\\none day - \\nthat day,\\n of course - with her face all bloated, her lip split\\nand bloody, buttons missing from her blouse, and even her underwear\\ntom. Can you believe it? She had done all this to back up her story, of\\ncourse, which her mother had to drag out of her. I can just see her\\ndoing it - putting blood on her blouse, tearing buttons off, ripping the\\nlace on her bra, making herself cry until her eyes were red, messing up\\nher hair, telling her mother a pack of lies. \"Not that I\\'m blaming people for believing her. I would have believed\\nher, too, this beautiful doll with a devil\\'s tongue. She comes home\\ncrying, she refuses to talk because it\\'s too embarrassing, but then she\\nspills it out. Of \\ncourse\\n people are going to believe her. And to make\\nmatters worse, it\\'s true, I do have a history of hospitalization for\\nmental problems, \\nI did\\n hit her in the face as hard as I could. Who\\'s\\ngoing to believe me? Probably just my husband. A few more days went by while I wrestled with the question of whether to tell him or not, but when I did, he believed me. Of course. I told him everything that had happened that day - the kind\\nof lesbian things she did to me, the way I slapped her in the face. Of\\ncourse, I didn\\'t tell him what I had felt. I couldn\\'t have told him that.\\nSo anyway, he was furious and insisted that he was going to go\\nstraight to the girl\\'s family. He said, \"You\\'re a married woman, after\\nall. You\\'re married to me. And you\\'re a mother. There\\'s no way you\\'re\\na lesbian. What a joke!\\' \"But I wouldn\\'t let him go. All he could do was make things worse. I\\nknew. I knew she was sick. I had seen hundreds of sick people, so I\\nknew. The girl was rotten inside. Peel off a layer of that beautiful skin,\\nand you\\'d find nothing but rotten flesh. I know it’s a terrible thing to\\nsay, but it’s true. And I knew that ordinary people could never know\\nthe truth about her, that there was no way we could win. She was an\\nexpert at manipulating the emotions of the adults around her, and we\\nhad nothing to prove our case. First of all, who’s going to believe that\\na 13-year-old girl set a homosexual trap for a woman in her thirties?\\nNo matter what we said, people would believe what they wanted to\\nbelieve. The more we straggled, the more vulnerable we’d be. \"There was only one thing for us to do, I said: we had to move. If I\\nstayed in that neighbourhood any longer, the stress would get to me;\\nmy mind would snap again. It was happening already. We had to get\\nout of there, go somewhere far away where nobody knew me. My\\nhusband wasn\\'t ready to go, though. It hadn\\'t dawned on him yet how\\ncritical I was. And the timing was terrible: he loved his work, and he\\nhad finally succeeded in getting us settled in our own house (we lived\\nin a little prefab), and our daughter was comfortable in her\\nkindergarten. \"Wait a minute,\\' he said, \"we can\\'t just up sticks and go.\\nI can\\'t find a job just like that. We\\'d have to sell the house, and we\\'d\\nhave to find another kindergarten. It\\'ll take two months at least.\" \"I can\\'t wait two months,” I told him. \"This is going to finish me off\\nonce and for all. I\\'m not kidding. Believe me, I know what I\\'m talking\\nabout.\\' The symptoms were starting already: my ears were ringing. and I was hearing things, and I couldn’t sleep. So he suggested that I\\nleave first, go somewhere by myself, and he would follow after he had\\ntaken care of what had to be done. \"\"No,\\' I said, \"I don’t want to go alone. I’ll fall apart if I don\\'t have\\nyou. I need you. Please, don\\'t leave me alone.’ He held me and pleaded\\nwith me to hang on a little longer. Just a month, he said. He would\\ntake care of everything - leave his job, sell the house, make\\narrangements for kindergarten, find a new job. There might be a\\nposition he could take in Australia, he said. He just wanted me to wait\\none month, and everything would be OK. What could I say to that? If\\nI tried to object, it would only isolate me even more.\" Reiko sighed and looked at the ceiling light. \"I couldn\\'t hold on for a month, though. One day, it happened again:\\nsnap!\\n And this time it was really bad. I took sleeping pills and turned\\non the gas. I woke up in a hospital bed, and it was all over. It took a\\nfew months before I had calmed down enough to think, and then I\\nasked my husband for a divorce. I told him it would be the best thing\\nfor him and for our daughter. He said he had no intention of divorcing\\nme. \"We can make a new start,\\' he said. \"We can go somewhere new,\\njust the three of us, and begin all over again.\\' \"It\\'s too late,\\' I told him.\\n\"Everything ended when you asked me to wait a month. If you really\\nwanted to start again, you shouldn’t have said that to me. Now, no\\nmatter where we go, no matter how far away we move, the same thing\\nwill happen all over again. And I\\'ll ask you for the same thing, and\\nmake you suffer. I don\\'t want to do that any more.\\' \"And so we divorced. Or I should say I divorced him. He married\\nagain two years ago, though. I\\'m still glad I made him leave me.\\nReally. I knew I\\'d be like this for the rest of my life, and I didn’t want\\nto drag anyone down with me. I didn\\'t want to force anyone to live in\\nconstant fear that I might lose my mind at any moment. \"He had been wonderful to me: an ideal husband, faithful, strong and\\npatient, someone I could put my complete trust in. He had done everything he could to heal me, and I had done everything I could to\\nbe\\n healed, both for his sake and for our daughter\\'s. And I had believed\\nin my recovery. I was happy for six years from the time we were\\nmarried. He got me 99 per cent of the way there, but the other one per\\ncent went crazy. \\nSnap!\\n Everything we had built up came crashing\\ndown. In one split second, everything tinned into nothing. And that\\ngirl was the one who did it.\" Reiko collected the cigarette butts she had crushed underfoot and\\ntossed them into the tin can. \"It\\'s a terrible story. We worked so hard, so hard, building our world\\none brick at a time. And when it fell apart, it happened just like that.\\nEverything was gone before you knew it.\" She stood up and thrust her hands in her pockets. \"Let\\'s go back. It\\'s\\nlate.\" The sky was darker, the cloud cover thicker than before, the moon\\ninvisible. Now, I realized, like Reiko I could smell the rain. And with\\nit mixed the fresh smell of the grapes in the bag I was holding. \"That\\'s why I can\\'t leave this place,\" she said. \"I\\'m afraid to get\\ninvolved with the outside world. I\\'m afraid to meet new people and\\nfeel new feelings.\" \"I understand,\" I said. \"But I think you can do it. I think \\nyou\\n can go\\noutside and make it.\" Reiko smiled, but said nothing. Naoko was on the sofa with a book. She had her legs crossed and\\npressed her hand against her temple as she read. Her fingers almost\\nseemed to be touching and testing each word that entered her head.\\nScattered drops of rain were beginning to tap on the roof. The\\nlamplight enveloped her, hovering around her like fine dust. After my\\nlong talk with Reiko, Naoko\\'s youthfulness struck me in a new way.\\n\"Sorry we\\'re so late,\" said Reiko, patting Naoko\\'s head. \"Enjoy yourselves?\" asked Naoko, looking up. \"Of course,\" said Reiko. \"Doing what?\" Naoko asked me, - just the two of you.\" \"Not at liberty to say. Miss,\" I answered. Naoko chuckled and set down her book. Then the three of us ate\\ngrapes to the sound of the rain. \"When it\\'s raining like this,\" said Naoko, \"it feels as if we\\'re the only\\nones in the world. I wish it would just keep raining so the three of us\\ncould stay together.\" \"Oh, sure,\" said Reiko, \"and while the two of you are going at it. I\\'m\\nsupposed to be fanning you or playing background music on my guitar\\nlike some dumb geisha? No, thanks!\" \"Oh, I\\'d let you have him once in a while,\" said Naoko, laughing. \"OK. then, count me in,\" said Reiko. \"Come on. rain, pour down!\" The rain did pour down, and kept pouring. Thunder shook the place\\nfrom time to time. When we had finished the grapes, Reiko went back\\nto her cigarettes and pulled out the guitar from under her bed and\\nstarted to play - first, \"Desafinado\" and \"The Girl from Ipanema\", then\\nsome Bacharach and a few Lennon and McCartney songs. Reiko and I\\nsipped wine again, and when that was gone we shared the brandy that\\nwas left in my flask. A warm, intimate mood took hold as the three of\\nus talked into the night, and I began to wish, with Naoko, that the rain\\nwould keep on falling. \"Will you come to see me again?\" she asked, looking at me. \"Of course I will,\" I said. \"And will you write?\" \"Every week.\" \"And will you add a few lines for me?\" asked Reiko. \"That I will,\" I\\nsaid. \"I\\'d be glad to.\" At eleven o\\'clock, Reiko unfolded the sofa and made a bed for me as\\nshe had the night before. We said goodnight and turned out the lights.\\nUnable to sleep, I took \\nThe Magic Mountain\\n and a torch from my\\nrucksack and read for a while. Just before midnight, the bedroom door\\nedged open and Naoko came and crawled in next to me. Unlike the night before, Naoko was the usual Naoko. Her eyes were in focus, her\\nmovements brisk. Bringing her mouth to my ear, she whispered, \"I\\ndon\\'t know, I can\\'t sleep.\" \"I can\\'t either,\" I said. Setting my book down and turning out the\\ntorch, I took her in my arms and kissed her. The darkness and the\\nsound of the rain enfolded us. \"How about Reiko?\" \"Don\\'t worry, she\\'s sound asleep. And when she sleeps, she \\nsleeps.\"\\nThen Naoko asked, \"Will you really come to see me again?\" \"Of course I will.\" \"Even if I can\\'t do anything for you?\" I nodded in the darkness. I could feel the full shape of her breasts\\nagainst me. I traced the outline of her body through her gown with the\\nflat of my hand. From shoulder to back to hips, I ran my hand over her\\nagain and again, driving the line and the softness of her body into my\\nbrain. After we had been in this gentle embrace for a while, Naoko\\ntouched her lips to my forehead and slipped out of bed. I could see her\\npale blue gown flash in the darkness like a fish. \"Goodbye,\" she called in a tiny voice. Listening to the rain, I dropped into a gentle sleep. It was still raining the following morning - a fine, almost invisible\\nautumn rain unlike the previous night\\'s downpour. You knew it was\\nraining only because of the ripples on puddles and the sound of\\ndripping from the eaves. I woke to see a milky white mist enclosing\\nthe window, but as the sun rose a breeze carried the mist away, and\\nthe surrounding woods and hills began to emerge. As we had done the day before, the three of us ate breakfast then went\\nout to attend to the aviary. Naoko and Reiko wore yellow plastic\\nraincapes with hoods. I put on a jumper and a waterproof windcheater.\\nOutside the air was damp and chilly. The birds, too, were avoiding the\\nrain, huddled together at the back of the cage. \"Gets cold here when it rains, doesn\\'t it?\" I said to Reiko. \"Every time it rains it\\'ll be a little colder now, until it turns to snow,\"\\nshe said. \"The clouds from the Sea of Japan dump tons of snow when\\nthey pass through here.\" \"What do you do with the birds in the winter?\" \"Bring them inside, of course. What are we supposed to do - dig them\\nout of the snow in spring all frozen? We defrost \\'em and bring \\'em\\nback to life and yell, OK. everybody, come and get it!\" I poked the wire mesh and the parrot flapped its wings and squawked\\n\"Shithead!\" \"Thank you!\" \"Crazy!\" \"Now, \\nthat\\n one I’d like to freeze,\" Naoko said with a melancholy look.\\n\"I really think \\nI will go\\n crazy if I have to hear that every morning.\" After cleaning the aviary, we went back to the flat. While I packed my\\nthings, the women put on their farm clothes. We left the building\\ntogether and parted just beyond the tennis court. They turned right and\\nI continued straight ahead. We called goodbye to each other, and I\\npromised I would come again. Naoko gave a little smile and\\ndisappeared around a corner. On my way to the gate I passed several people, all wearing the same\\nyellow raincapes that Naoko and Reiko wore, all with their hoods up.\\nColours shone with an exceptional clarity in the rain: the ground was a\\ndeep black, the pine branches a brilliant green, and the people\\nwrapped in yellow looking like otherworldly spirits that were only\\nallowed to wander the earth on rainy mornings. They floated over the\\nground in silence, carrying farm tools, baskets and sacks. The gatekeeper remembered my name and marked it on the list of\\nvisitors as I left. \"I see you\\'re here from Tokyo,\" the old fellow said. \"I\\nwent there once. Just once. They serve great pork.\" \"They do?\" I asked, uncertain how to answer him. \"I didn\\'t like much of what I ate in Tokyo, but the pork was delicious.\\nI expect they have some special way of rearing \\'em, eh?\" I said I didn’t know, it was the first I\\'d heard of it. \"When was that, by the way, when you went to Tokyo?\" \"Hmm, let\\'s see,\" he said, cocking his head, \"was it the time His\\nMajesty the Crown prince got married? My son was in Tokyo and said\\nI ought to see the place at least once. That must have been 1959.\" \"Oh, well then, sure, pork must have been good in Tokyo back then,\" I\\nsaid. \"How about these days?\" he asked. I wasn\\'t sure, I said, but I hadn\\'t heard anything special about it. This\\nseemed to disappoint him. He gave every sign of wanting to continue\\nour conversation, but I told him I had to catch a bus and started\\nwalking in the direction of the road. Patches of fog remained floating\\non the path where it skirted the stream, but the breeze carried them\\nover to the steep flanks of a nearby mountain. Every now and then as I\\nwalked along I would stop, turn, and heave a deep sigh for no\\nparticular reason. I felt as though I had arrived on a planet where the\\ngravity was a little different. Yes, of course, I told myself, feeling sad:\\nI was in the outside world now. Back at the dorm by 4.30, I changed straight away and left for the\\nrecord shop in Shinjuku to put in my hours. I looked after the shop\\nfrom six o\\'clock to 10.30 and sold a few records, but mainly I sat there\\nin a daze, watching an incredible variety of people streaming by\\noutside. There were families and couples and drunks and gangsters\\nand lively-looking girls in short skirts and bearded hippies and bar\\nhostesses and some indefinable types. Whenever I put on hard rock,\\nhippies and runaway kids would gather outside to dance and sniff\\npaint thinner or just sit on the ground doing nothing in particular, and\\nwhen I put on Tony Bennett, they would disappear. Next door was a shop where a middle-aged, sleepy-eyed man sold\\n\"adult toys\". I couldn’t imagine why anyone would want the kind of\\nsex paraphernalia he had there, but he seemed to do a roaring trade. In\\nthe alley diagonally across from the record shop I saw a drunken\\nstudent vomiting. In the game arcade across from us at another angle. the cook from a local restaurant was killing time on his break with a\\ngame of bingo that took cash bets. Beneath the eaves of a shop that\\nhad closed for the night, a swarthy homeless guy was crouching,\\nmotionless. A girl with pale pink lipstick who couldn\\'t have been more\\nthan 12 or 13 came in and asked me to play the Rolling Stones\\'\\n\"Jumpin\\' Jack Flash\". When I found the record and put it on for her,\\nshe started snapping her fingers to the rhythm and shaking her hips as\\nshe danced around the shop. Then she asked me for a cigarette. I gave\\nher one of the manager\\'s, which she smoked gratefully, and when the\\nrecord ended she left the shop without so much as a \"thank you\".\\nEvery 15 minutes or so I would hear the siren of an ambulance or\\npolice car. Three drunk company executives in suits and ties came by,\\nlaughing at the top of their voices every time they yelled \"Nice arse!\"\\nat a pretty, long-haired girl in a phone box. The more I watched, the more confused I became. What the hell was\\nthis all about? I wondered. What could it possibly mean? The manager came back from dinner and said to me, \"Hey, know\\nwhat, Watanabe? Night before last I made it with the boutique chick.\"\\nFor some time now he had had his eye on the girl who worked at a\\nboutique nearby, and every once in a while he would take a record\\nfrom the shop as a gift for her. \"Good for you,\" I said to him, whereupon he told me every last detail\\nof his conquest. \"If you really wanna make a chick, here\\'s what ya gotta do,\"\\nhe began, very pleased with himself. \"First, ya gotta give \\'er presents.\\nThen ya gotta get \\'er drunk. I mean really drunk. Then ya just gotta do\\nit. It\\'s easy. See what I mean?\" Head mixed up as ever, I boarded the commuter train and went back\\nto my dorm. Closing the curtains, I turned off the lights, stretched out\\nin bed, and felt as if Naoko might come crawling in beside me at any\\nmoment. With my eyes closed, I could feel the soft swell of her\\nbreasts on my chest, hear her whispering to me, and feel the outline of her body in my hands. In the darkness, I returned to that small world\\nof hers. I smelled the meadow grass, heard the rain at night. I thought\\nof her naked, as I had seen her in the moonlight, and pictured her\\ncleaning the aviary and tending to the vegetables with that soft,\\nbeautiful body of hers wrapped in the yellow raincape. Clutching my\\nerection. I thought of Naoko until I came. This seemed to clear my\\nbrain a little, but it didn\\'t help me sleep. I felt exhausted, desperate for\\nsleep, but it simply refused to cooperate. I got out of bed and stood at the window, my unfocused eyes\\nwandering out towards the flagpole. Without the national flag attached\\nto it, the pole looked like a gigantic white bone thrusting up into the\\ndarkness of night. What was Naoko doing now? I wondered. Of\\ncourse, she must be sleeping, sleeping deeply, shrouded in the\\ndarkness of that curious little world of hers. Let her be spared from\\nanguished dreams, I found myself hoping. In P.E. class the next morning, Thursday, I swam several lengths of\\nthe 50-metre pool. The vigorous exercise cleared my head some more\\nand gave me an appetite. After eating a good-sized lunch at a student\\nrestaurant known for its good-sized lunches, I was on my way to the\\nliterature department library to do some research when I bumped into\\nMidori Kobayashi. She had someone with her, a petite girl with\\nglasses, but when she spotted me, she approached me alone. \"Where you going?\" she asked. \"Lit. library,\" I said. \"Why don\\'t you forget it and come have lunch with me?\" \"I\\'ve already\\neaten.\" \"So what? Eat again.\" We ended up going to a nearby cafe where she had a plate of curry\\nand I had a cup of coffee. She wore a white, longsleeved shirt under a\\nyellow woollen vest with a fish knitted into the design, a narrow gold\\nnecklace, and a Disney watch. She seemed to enjoy the curry and\\ndrank three glasses of water with it. \"Where\\'ve you been?\" Midori asked. \"I don’t know how many times I\\ncalled.\" \"Was there something you wanted to talk about?\" \"Nothing special. I\\njust called.\" \"I see.\" \"You see what?\" \"Nothing. Just \"I see\\',\" I said. \"Any fires lately?\" \"That was fun, wasn\\'t it? It didn\\'t do much damage, but\\nthat smoke made it feel real. Great stuff.\" Midori gulped another glass\\nof water, took a breath and studied my face for a while. \"Hey, what’s\\nwrong with you?\" she asked. \"You’ve got this spaced-out face. Your\\neyes aren\\'t focused.\" \"I\\'m OK,\" I said. \"I just came back from a trip and I\\'m tired.\" \"You look like you\\'ve just seen a ghost.\" \"I see.\" \"Hey, do you have \"German and R.E. \"Can you skip \\'en: \"Not\\nGerman. I\\'ve \"When’s it over?\" \"Two.\" \"OK. How about going into the city with me after that some drinks ?\"\\n\"At two in the afternoon?!\" \"For a change, why not? You look so spaced. Come on, come drinking\\nwith me and get a little life into you. That’s what I want to do - drink\\nwith you and get some life into myself. What do you say?\" \"OK. let’s go,\" I said with a sigh. \"I’ll look for you in the Lit. quad at\\ntwo.\" After German we caught a bus to Shinjuku and went to an\\nunderground bar called DUG behind the Kinokuniya bookshop. We\\neach started with two vodka and tonics. \"I come here once in a while,\" she said. \"They don\\'t make you feel\\nembarrassed to be drinking in the afternoon.\" \"Do you drink in the afternoon a lot?\" \"Sometimes,\" she said, rattling the ice in her glass. \"Sometimes, when\\nthe world gets too hard to live in, I come here for a vodka and tonic.\"\\n\"Does the world get hard to live in?\" \"Sometimes,\" said Midori. \"I’ve got my own special little problems.\"\\n\"Like what?\" \"Like family, like boyfriends, like irregular periods. Stuff.\" \"So have\\nanother drink.\" \"I will.\" I beckoned to the waiter and ordered two more vodka and tonics.\\n\"Remember how, when you came over that Sunday, you kissed me?\"\\nMidori asked. \"I\\'ve been thinking about it. It was nice. Really nice.\"\\n\"That\\'s nice.\" \"\"That’s nice’,\" she mimicked. \"The way you talk is so weird!\" \"It is?\" \"Anyway, I was thinking, that time. I was thinking how great it would\\nbe if that had been the first time in my life a boy had kissed me. If I\\ncould switch around the order of my life, I would absolutely,\\nabsolutely make that my first kiss. And then I would live the rest of\\nmy life thinking stuff like: Hey, I wonder whatever happened to that\\nboy named Watanabe I gave my first kiss to on the laundry deck, now\\nthat he’s 58? Wouldn’t that be great?\" \"Yeah, really,\" I said, cracking a pistachio nut. \"Hey, what is it with you? Why are you so spaced out? You still\\nhaven\\'t answered me.\" I probably still haven\\'t completely adapted to the world.’ I said after\\ngiving it some thought. \"I don\\'t know, I feel like this isn\\'t the real\\nworld. The people, the scene: they just don’t seem real to me.\" Midori rested an elbow on the bar and looked at me. \"There was\\nsomething like that in a Jim Morrison song. I\\'m pretty sure.\" \"People are strange when you\\'re a stranger.\" \"Peace,\" said Midori. Peace,\" I said. \"You really ought to go to Uruguay with me,\" Midori said, still\\nleaning on the bar. \"Girlfriend, family, university - just dump \\'em all.\"\\n\"Not a bad idea,\" I said, laughing. \"Don\\'t you think it would be wonderful to get rid of everything and\\neverybody and just go somewhere where you don\\'t know a soul?\\nSometimes I feel like doing that. I really, really want to do it\\nsometimes. Like, suppose you whisked me somewhere far, far away. I\\'d make lots of babies for you as tough as little bulls. And we’d all\\nlive happily ever after, rolling on the floor.\" I laughed and drank my third vodka and tonic. \"I guess you don\\'t really want lots of babies as tough as little bulls\\nyet,\" said Midori. \"I\\'m intrigued,\" I said. \"I\\'d like to see what they look like.\" \"That\\'s OK, you don\\'t have to want them,\" said Midori, eating a\\npistachio. \"Here I am, drinking in the afternoon, saying whatever pops\\ninto my head: \"I wanna dump everything and run off somewhere.\\'\\nWhat\\'s the point of going to Uruguay? All they\\'ve got there is donkey\\nshit.\" \"You may be right.\" \"Donkey shit everywhere. Here a shit, there a shit, the whole world is\\ndonkey shit. Hey, I can\\'t open this. You take it.\" Midori handed me a\\npistachio nut. I straggled with it until I cracked it open. \"But oh, what\\na relief\\n it was last Sunday! Going up to the laundry deck with you,\\nwatching the fire, drinking beer, singing songs. I don\\'t know \\nhow\\n long\\nit\\'s been since I had such a total sense of \\nrelief.\\n People are always\\ntrying to \\nforce\\n stuff on me. The minute they see me they start telling\\nme what to do. At least you don\\'t try to force stuff on me.\" \"I don\\'t know you well enough to force stuff on you.\" \"You mean, if you knew me better, you\\'d force stuff on me like\\neveryone else?\" \"It\\'s possible,\" I said. \"That\\'s how people live in the real world:\\nforcing stuff on each other.\" \"You wouldn’t do that. I can tell. I\\'m an expert when it comes to\\nforcing stuff and having stuff forced on you. You\\'re not the type.\\nThat\\'s why I can relax with you. Do you have any idea how many\\npeople there are in the world who \\nlike\\n to force stuff on people and\\nhave stuff forced on them? \\nTons!\\n And then they make a big fuss, like\\n\"I forced her\\', \"You forced me!\\' That\\'s what they like. But I don’t like\\nit. I just do it because I have to.\" \"What kind of stuff do you force on people or they force on you?\"\\nMidori put an ice-cube in her mouth and sucked on it for a while. \"Do you want to get to know me better?\" she asked. \"Yeah, kind of.\"\\n\"Hey, look, I just asked you, \"Do you want to get to know me better?\\'\\nWhat sort of answer is that?\" \"Yes, Midori, I would like to get to know you better,\" I said. \"Really?\"\\n\"Yes, really.\" \"Even if you had to turn your eyes away from what you saw? \\'Are you that bad?\" \"Well, in a way,\" Midori said with a frown. \"I want another drink.\" I called the waiter and ordered a fourth round of drinks. Until they\\ncame, Midori cupped her chin in her hand with her elbow on the bar. I\\nkept quiet and listened to Thelonious Monk playing \"Honeysuckle\\nRose\". There were five or six other customers in the place, but we\\nwere the only ones drinking alcohol. The rich smell of coffee gave the\\ngloomy interior an intimate atmosphere. \"Are you free this Sunday?\" Midori asked. \"I think I told you before. I\\'m always free on Sunday. Until I go to\\nwork at six.\" \"OK. then, \\nthis\\n Sunday, will you hang out with me?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"I\\'ll pick you up at your dorm Sunday morning. I\\'m not sure exactly\\nwhat time, though. Is that OK?\" \"Fine,\" I said. \"No problem.\" \"Now, let me ask you: do you have any idea what I would like to do\\nright now?\" \"I can\\'t imagine.\" \"Well, first of all, I want to lie down in a big, wide, fluffy bed. I want\\nto get all comfy and drunk and not have any donkey shit anywhere\\nnearby, and I want to have you lying down next to me. And then, little\\nby little, you take off my clothes. \\nSooo\\n tenderly. The way a mother\\nundresses a little child. \\nSooo\\n softly.\" \"Hmm ...\" \"And I\\'m just spacing out and feeling really nice until, all of a sudden\\nI realize what\\'s happening and I yell at you \"Stop it, Watanabe!’ And\\nthen I say \"I really like you, Watanabe, but I\\'m seeing someone else. I\\ncan\\'t do this. I\\'m very proper about these things, believe it or not, so\\nplease stop.\\' But you\\ndon\\'t stop.\" \"But \\nI would\\n stop,\" I said. \"I know that. Never mind, this is just my fantasy,\" said Midori. \"So\\nthen you show it to me. Your thing. Sticking right up. I immediately\\ncover my eyes, of course, but I can\\'t help seeing it for a split second.\\nAnd I say, \"Stop it! Don\\'t \\ndo\\n that! I don\\'t want anything so big and\\nhard!\\'\" \"It\\'s not so big. Just ordinary.\" \"Never mind, this is a fantasy. So then you put on this really sad face,\\nand I feel sorry for you and try to comfort you. There there, poor\\nthing.\" \"And you\\'re telling me that\\'s what you want to do now?\" \"That\\'s it.\" \"Oh boy.\" We left the bar after five rounds of vodka and tonic. When I tried to\\npay, Midori slapped my hand and paid with a brand-new #10,000 note\\nshe took from her purse. \"It\\'s OK,\" she said. \"I just got paid, and I invited \\nyou.\\n Of course, if\\nyou\\'re a card-carrying fascist and you refuse to let a woman buy you a\\ndrink. ..\" \"No no. I’m OK.\" \"And I didn\\'t let you put it in, either.\" \"Because it’s so big and hard,\" I\\nsaid. \"Right,\" said Midori. \"Because it’s so big and hard.\" A little drunk, Midori missed one step, and we almost fell back down\\nthe stairs. The layer of clouds that had darkened the sky was gone now, and the late afternoon sun poured its gentle light on the city\\nstreets. Midori and I wandered around for a while. She said she\\nwanted to climb a tree, but unfortunately there were no climbable trees\\nin Shinjuku, and the Shinjuku Imperial Gardens were closing. \"Too bad,\" said Midori. \"I love climbing trees.\" We continued walking and window-shopping, and soon the street\\nscene seemed more real to me than it had before. \"I\\'m glad I ran into you,\" I said. \"I think I\\'m a little more adapted to\\nthe world now.\" Midori stopped short and peered at me. \"It\\'s true,\" she said. \"Your\\neyes are much more in focus than they were. See? Hanging out with\\nme does you good.\" \"No doubt about it,\" I said. At 5.30 Midori said she had to go home and make dinner. I said I\\nwould take a bus back to my dorm, and saw her as far as the station.\\n\"Know what I want to do now?\" Midori asked me as she was leaving. \"I have absolutely no idea what you could be thinking,\" I said. \"I want you and me to be captured by pirates. Then they strip us and\\npress us together face to face all naked and wind these ropes around\\nus.\" \"Why would they do a thing like that?\" \"Perverted pirates,\" she said. \"You\\'re\\n the perverted one,\" I said. \"So then they lock us in the hold and say, \"In one hour, we\\'re gonna\\nthrow you into the sea, so have a good time\\nuntil then’.\" \"And ... ?\" \"So we enjoy ourselves for an hour, rolling all over the place and\\ntwisting our bodies.\" \"And that\\'s the main thing you want to do now?\" \"That’s it.\" \"Oh boy,\" I said, shaking my head. Midori came for me at 9.30 on Sunday morning. I had just woken up\\nand hadn\\'t washed my face. Somebody pounded on my door, yelling\\n\"Hey, Watanabe, it\\'s a woman!\" I went down to the lobby to find\\nMidori sitting there with her legs crossed wearing an incredibly short\\ndenim skirt, yawning. Every student passing by on his way to\\nbreakfast slowed down to stare at her long, slim legs. She did have\\nreally nice legs. \"Am I too early?\" she asked. \"I bet you just woke up.\" \"Can you give me 15 minutes? I\\'ll wash my face and shave.\" \"I don’t\\nmind waiting, but all these guys are staring at\\nmy legs.\" \"What d’you expect, coming into a men\\'s dorm in such a short skirt?\\nOf course they\\'re going to stare.\" \"Oh, well, it\\'s OK. I\\'m wearing really cute panties today - all pink and\\nfrilly and lacy.\" \"That just makes it worse,\" I said with a sigh. I went back to my room\\nand washed and shaved as fast as I could, put on a blue button-down\\nshirt and a grey tweed sports coat, then went back down and ushered\\nMidori out through the dorm gate. I was in a cold sweat. \"Tell me, Watanabe,\" Mdori said, looking up at the dorm buildings,\\n\"do all the guys in here wank - rub-a-dub-dub?\" \"Probably,\" I said. \"Do guys think about girls when they do that?\" \"I suppose so. I kind of doubt that anyone thinks about the stock\\nmarket or verb conjugations or the Suez Canal when they wank. Nope,\\nI\\'m pretty sure just about everybody thinks about girls.\" \"The Suez Canal?\" \"For example.\" \"So I suppose they think about \\nparticular\\n girls, right?\" \"Shouldn\\'t you\\nbe asking your boyfriend about that?\" I said. \"Why should I have to explain stuff like this to you on a Sunday\\nmorning?\" \"I was just curious,\" she said. \"Besides, he’d get angry if I asked him\\nabout stuff like that. He\\'d say girls aren\\'t supposed to ask all those\\nquestions.\" \"A perfectly normal point of view. I\\'d say.\" \"But I want to know. This is pure curiosity. Do guys think about\\nparticular girls when they wank?\" I gave up trying to avoid the question. \"Well, I do at least. I don\\'t know about anybody else.\" \"Have you ever thought about me while you were doing it? Tell me the truth. I won\\'t be angry.\" \"No, I haven\\'t, to tell the truth,\" I answered honestly. \"Why not?\\nAren\\'t I attractive enough?\" \"Oh, you\\'re attractive, all right. You\\'re cute, and sexy outfits look\\ngreat on you.\" \"So why don\\'t you think about me?\" \"Well, first of all, I think of you as a friend, so I don\\'t want to involve\\nyou in my sexual fantasies, and second -\" \"You\\'ve got somebody else you\\'re supposed to be thinking about.\"\\n\"That\\'s about the size of it,\" I said. \"You have good manners even when it comes to something like this,\"\\nMidori said. \"That\\'s what I like about you. Still, couldn’t you allow me\\njust one brief appearance? I want to be in one of your sexual fantasies\\nor daydreams or whatever you call them. I\\'m asking you because we\\'re\\nfriends. Who else can I ask for something like that? I can\\'t just walk\\nup to anyone and say, \"When you wank tonight, will you please think\\nof me for a second?\\' It\\'s \\nbecause I\\n think of you as a friend that I\\'m\\nasking. And I want you to tell me later what it was like. You know,\\nwhat you did and stuff.\" I let out a sigh. \"You can\\'t put it in, though. Because we\\'re just friends. Right? As\\nlong as you don\\'t put it in, you can do anything you like, think\\nanything you want.\" \"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve never done it with so many restrictions before,\" I\\nsaid. \"Will you just think about me?\" \"All right. I’ll think about you.\" \"You know, Watanabe, I don’t want you to get the wrong impression -\\nthat I\\'m a nymphomaniac or frustrated or a tease or anything. I\\'m just\\ninterested\\n in that stuff. I want to \\nknow\\n about it. I grew up surrounded\\nby nothing but girls in a girls\\' school, you know that. I want to find out\\nwhat guys are thinking and how their bodies are put together. And not\\njust from pull-out sections in the women\\'s magazines but actual \\ncase\\nstudies.\" \"Case studies?\" I groaned. \"But my boyfriend doesn\\'t like it when I want to know things or try\\nthings. He gets angry, calls me a nympho or crazy. He won\\'t even let\\nme give him a blow job. Now, that\\'s one thing I\\'m dying to study.\"\\n\"Uh-huh.\" \"Do \\nyou\\n hate getting blow jobs?\" \"No, not really, I don\\'t hate it.\" \"Would you say you \\nlike\\n it?\" \"Yeah, I’d say that. But can we talk about this next time? Here it is, a\\nreally nice Sunday morning, and I don\\'t want to ruin it talking about\\nwanking and blow jobs. Let\\'s talk about something else. Is your\\nboyfriend at the same university as us?\" \"Nope, he goes to another one, of course. We met at school during a\\nclub activity. I was in the girls\\' school, he was in the boys\\', and you\\nknow how they do those things, joint concerts and stuff. We got\\nserious after our exams, though. Hey, Watanabe.\" \"What?\" \"You only have to do it once. Just think about me, OK?\" \"OK. I’ll give it a try, next time,\" I said, throwing in the towel. We took a commuter train to Ochanomizu. When we transferred at Shinjuku I bought a thin sandwich at a stand in the station to make up\\nfor the breakfast I hadn\\'t eaten. The coffee I had with it tasted like\\nboiled printer\\'s ink. The Sunday morning trains were filled with\\ncouples and families on outings. A group of boys with baseball bats\\nand matching uniforms scampered around inside the carriage. Several\\nof the girls on the train had short skirts on, but none as short as\\nMidori\\'s. Midori would pull on hers every now and then as it rode up.\\nSome of the men stared at her thighs, which made me feel uneasy, but\\nshe didn’t seem to mind. \"Know what I\\'d like to do right now?\" she whispered when we had\\nbeen travelling a while. \"No idea,\" I said. \"But please, don\\'t talk about that stuff here.\\nSomebody\\'ll hear you.\" \"Too bad. This one\\'s kind of wild,\" Midori said with obvious\\ndisappointment. \\'Anyway, why are we going to Ochanomizu?\" \"Just come along, you\\'ll see.\" With all the cram schools around Ochanomizu Station, on Sunday the\\narea was full of school kids on their way to classes or exam practice.\\nMidori barged through the crowds clutching the strap of her shoulder\\nbag with one hand and my hand with the other. Without warning, she asked me, \"Hey, Watanabe, can you explain the\\ndifference between the English present subjunctive and past\\nsubjunctive?\" \"I think I can,\" I said. \"Let me ask you, then, what possible use is stuff like that for everyday\\nlife?\" \"None at all,\" I said. \"It may not serve any concrete purpose, but it\\ndoes\\n give you some kind of training to help you grasp things in\\ngeneral more systematically.\" Midori gave that a moment\\'s serious thought. \"You\\'re amazing,\" she\\nsaid. \"That never occurred to me before. I always thought of things like the subjunctive case and differential calculus and chemical\\nsymbols as totally useless. A pain in the neck. So I\\'ve always ignored\\nthem. Now I have to wonder if my whole life has been a mistake.\"\\n\"You\\'ve ignored them?\" \"Yeah. Like, for me, they didn’t exist. I don\\'t have the slightest idea\\nwhat \"sine\\' and \"cosine\\' mean.\" \"That\\'s incredible! How did you pass your exams? How did you get\\ninto university?\" \"Don\\'t be silly,\" said Midori. \"You don’t have to know anything to\\npass entrance exams! All you need is a little intuition - and I have\\ngreat intuition. \"Choose the correct answer from the following three.\\' I\\nknow immediately which one is right.\" \"My intuition\\'s not as good as yours, so I have to be systematic to\\nsome extent. Like the way a magpie collects bits of glass in a hollow\\ntree.\" \"Does it serve some purpose?\" \"I wonder. It probably makes it easier to do some things.\" \"What kind\\nof things? Give me an example.\" \"Metaphysical thought, say.\\nMastering several languages.\" \"What good does that do?\" \"It depends on the person who does it. It serves a purpose for some, and not for others. But mainly it\\'s training. Whether it serves a purpose or not is another question. Like I said.\" \"Hmm,\" said Midori, seemingly impressed. She led me by the hand down the hill. \"You know, Watanabe, you\\'re really good at explaining things to people.\" \"I wonder,\" I said. \"It\\'s true. I\\'ve asked hundreds of people what use the\\nEnglish subjunctive is, and not one of them gave me a good,\\nclear answer like yours. Not even English teachers. They either\\ngot confused or angry or laughed it off. Nobody ever gave me\\na decent answer. If somebody like you had been around when\\nI asked my question, and had given me a proper explanation, even I might have been interested in the subjunctive. Damn!\" \"Hmm,\"\\nI said. \"Have you ever read \\nDas Kapital?\" \"Yeah. Not the whole thing, of course, but parts, like most\\npeople.\" \"Did you understand it?\" \"I understood some bits, not others. You have to acquire the\\nnecessary intellectual apparatus to read a book like \\nDas Kapital. I think I understand the general idea of Marxism, though.\" \"Do you\\nthink a first-year student who hasn\\'t read books like that can understand \\nDas Kapital\\n just by reading it?\" \"That\\'s pretty\\nnigh impossible. I\\'d say.\" \"You know, when I went to university I joined a folk-music\\nclub. I just wanted to sing songs. But the members were a load of\\nfrauds. I get goose-bumps just thinking about them. The first thing\\nthey tell you when you enter the club is you have to read Marx. \"Read\\npage so-and-so to such-and-such for next time.\\' Somebody gave a\\nlecture on how folk songs have to be deeply involved with society and\\nthe radical movement. So, what the hell, I went home and tried as hard\\nas I could to read it, but I didn’t understand a thing. It was worse than\\nthe subjunctive. I gave up after three pages. So I went to the next\\nweek\\'s meeting like a good little scout and said I had read it, but I\\ncouldn\\'t understand it. From that point on they treated me like an idiot.\\nI had no critical awareness of the class straggle, they said, I was a\\nsocial cripple. I mean, this was serious. And all because I said I\\ncouldn\\'t understand a piece of writing. Don\\'t you think they were\\nterrible?\" \"Uh-huh,\" I said. \"And their so-called discussions were terrible, too. Everybody would\\nuse big words and pretend they knew what was going on. But I would\\nask questions whenever I didn\\'t understand something. \"What is this\\nimperialist exploitation stuff you\\'re talking about? Is it connected somehow to the East India Company?\\' \"Does smashing the\\neducational-industrial complex mean we\\'re not supposed to work for a\\ncompany after we graduate?\\' And stuff like that. But nobody was\\nwilling to explain anything to me. Far from it - they got \\nreally\\n angry.\\nCan you believe it?\" \"Yeah, I can,\" I said. \"One guy yelled at me, \"You stupid bitch, how do you live like that\\nwith nothing in your brain?\\' Well, that did it. I wasn\\'t going to put up\\nwith that. OK, so I\\'m not so smart. I\\'m working class. But it\\'s the\\nworking class that keeps the world running, and it\\'s the working\\nclasses that get exploited. What kind of revolution is it that just throws\\nout big words that working-class people can\\'t understand? What kind\\nof crap social revolution is that? I mean. \\nI\\'d\\n like to make the world a\\nbetter place, too. If somebody\\'s really being exploited, we\\'ve got to\\nput a stop to it. That\\'s what I believe, and that\\'s why I ask questions.\\nAm I right, or what?\" \"You\\'re right.\" \"So that\\'s when it hit me. These guys are fakes. All they\\'ve got on\\ntheir minds is impressing the new girls with the big words they\\'re so\\nproud of, while sticking their hands up their skirts. And when they\\ngraduate, they cut their hair short and march off to work for\\nMitsubishi or IBM or Fuji Bank. They marry pretty wives who\\'ve\\nnever read Marx and have kids they give fancy new names to that are\\nenough to make you puke. Smash \\nwhat\\n educational-industrial\\ncomplex? Don\\'t make me laugh! And the new members were just as\\nbad. They didn\\'t understand a thing either, but they pretended to and\\nthey were laughing at me. After the meeting, they told me, \"Don\\'t be\\nsilly! So what if you don\\'t understand? Just agree with everything they\\nsay.’ Hey, Watanabe, I\\'ve got stuff that made me even madder than\\nthat. Wanna hear it?\" \"Sure, why not?\" \"Well, one time they called a late-night political meeting, and they told each girl to make 20 rice balls for midnight snacks. I mean, talk\\nabout sex discrimination! I decided to keep quiet for a change, though,\\nand showed up like a good girl with my 20 rice balls, complete with\\numeboshi inside and nori outside. And what do you think I got for my\\nefforts? Afterwards people complained because my rice balls had \\nonly\\numeboshi inside, and I hadn\\'t brought anything along to go with them!\\nThe other girls stuffed theirs with cod roe and salmon, and they\\nincluded nice, thick slices of fried egg. I got so furious I couldn\\'t talk!\\nWho the hell do these revolution’-mongers think they are making a\\nfuss over rice balls? They should be grateful for umeboshi and nori.\\nThink of the children starving in India!\" I laughed. \"So then what happened with your club?\" \"I left in June, I was so furious,\" Midori said. \"Most of these student\\ntypes are total frauds. They\\'re scared to death somebody\\'s gonna find\\nout they don\\'t know something. They all read the same books and they\\nall spout the same slogans, aid they love listening to John Coltrane\\nand seeing Pasolini movies. You call that \"revolution?\"\\' \"Hey, don’t ask me, I\\'ve never actually seen a revolution.\" \"Well, if\\nthat\\'s revolution, you can stick it. They\\'d probably shoot me for\\nputting umeboshi in my rice balls. They’d shoot you, too, for\\nunderstanding the subjunctive.\" \"It could happen.\" \"Believe me, I know what I\\'m talking about. I\\'m working class.\\nRevolution or not, the working class will just keep on scraping a\\nliving in the same old shitholes. And what is a revolution? It sure as\\nhell isn\\'t just changing the name on city hall. But those guys don\\'t\\nknow that - those guys with their big words. Tell me, Watanabe, have\\nyou ever seen a taxman?\" \"Never.\" \"Well I have. Lots of times. They come barging in and acting big.\\n\"What\\'s \\nthis\\n ledger for?\\' \"Hey, you keep pretty sloppy records.\\' \"You\\ncall this a \\nbusiness\\n expense?\\' \"I want to see all your receipts \\nright\\nnow.\\'\\n Meanwhile, we\\'re crouching in the comer, and when suppertime comes we have to treat them to sushi deluxe - home delivered. Let me\\ntell you, though, my father never once cheated on his taxes. That\\'s just\\nhow he is, a real old-fashioned straight arrow. But tell that to the\\ntaxman. All he can do is dig and dig and dig and dig. \"Income\\'s a little\\nlow here, don\\'t you think?\\' Well, of \\ncourse\\n the income\\'s low when\\nyou\\'re not making any money! I wanted to scream: \"Go do this where\\nthey\\'ve got some money!\\' Do you think the taxman\\'s attitude would\\nchange if there was a revolution ?\" \"Highly doubtful, highly doubtful.\" \"That does it, then. I\\'m not going to believe in any damned revolution.\\nLove is all I\\'m going to believe in.\" \"Peace,\" I said. \"Peace,\" said Midori. \"Hey, where are we going?\" I asked. \"The hospital,\" she said. \"My father\\'s there. It\\'s my turn to stay with\\nhim all day.\" \"Your father?! I thought he was in Uruguay!\" \"That was a lie,\" said Midori in a matter-of-fact tone. \"He\\'s been\\nscreaming about going to Uruguay forever, but he could never do that.\\nHe can hardly get himself out of Tokyo.\" \"How bad is he?\" I asked. \"It\\'s just a matter of time,\" she said. We walked on in silence. \"I know what I\\'m talking about. It\\'s the same thing my mother had. A\\nbrain tumour. Can you believe it? It\\'s hardly been two years since she\\ndied of a brain tumour, and now he\\'s got one.\" The University Hospital corridors were noisy and crowded with\\nweekend visitors and patients who had less serious symptoms, and\\neverywhere hung that special hospital smell, a cloud of disinfectant\\nand visitors\\' bouquets, and urine and mattresses, while nurses surged\\nback and forth with a dry clattering of heels. Midori\\'s father was in a semi-private room in the bed nearest the door. Stretched out, he looked like some tiny creature with a fatal wound.\\nHe lay on his side, limp, the drooping left arm inert, jabbed with an\\nintravenous needle. He was a small, skinny man who gave the\\nimpression that he would only get smaller and thinner. A white\\nbandage encircled his head, and his pasty white arms were dotted with\\nthe holes left by injections or intravenous drips. His half-open eyes\\nstared at a fixed point in space, bloodshot spheres that twitched in our\\ndirection when we entered the room. For some ten seconds they stayed\\nfocused on us, then drifted back to that fixed point in space. You knew when you saw those eyes he was going to die soon. There\\nwas no sign of life in his flesh, just the barest trace of what had once\\nbeen a life. His body was like a dilapidated old house from which all\\nthe fixtures and fittings have been removed, awaiting its final\\ndemolition. Around the dry lips clumps of whiskers sprouted like\\nweeds. So, I thought, even after so much of a man\\'s life force has been\\nlost, his beard continues to grow. Midori said hello to a fat man in the bed by the window. He nodded\\nand smiled, apparently unable to talk. He coughed a few times and.\\nafter sipping some water from a glass by his pillow, he shifted his\\nweight and rolled on his side, turning to gaze out of the window.\\nBeyond the window could be seen only a pole and some power lines,\\nnothing more, not even a cloud in the sky. \"How are you feeling. Daddy?\" said Midori, speaking into her father\\'s\\near as if testing a microphone. \"How are you today?\" Her father moved his lips. <Not good> he said, not so much speaking\\nthe words as forming them from dried air at the back of his throat.\\n<Head> he said. \"You have a headache?\" Midori asked. <Yuh > he said, apparently unable to pronounce more than a syllable\\nor two at a time. \"Well, no wonder,\" she said, \"you\\'ve just had your head cut open. Of\\ncourse it hurts. Too bad, but try to be brave. This is my friend. Watanabe.\" \"Glad to meet you,\" I said. Midori\\'s father opened his lips halfway,\\nthen closed them again. Midori gestured towards a plastic stool near the foot of the bed and\\nsuggested I sit down. I did as I was told. Midori gave her father a\\ndrink of water and asked if he\\'d like a piece of fruit or some jellied\\nfruit dessert. <No> he said, and when Midori insisted that he had to\\neat something, he said <1 ate). A water bottle, a glass, a dish and a small clock stood on a night table\\nnear the head of the bed. From a large paper bag under the table,\\nMidori took some fresh pyjamas, underwear, and other things,\\nstraightened them out and put them into the locker by the door. There\\nwas food for the patient at the bottom of the bag: two grapefruits, fruit\\njelly and three cucumbers. \"Cucumbers?! What are \\nthese\\n doing in here?\" Midori asked. \"I can\\'t\\nimagine what my sister was thinking. I told her on the phone exactly\\nwhat I wanted her to buy, and I\\'m sure I never mentioned cucumbers!\\nShe was supposed to bring kiwi fruit.\" \"Maybe she misunderstood you,\" I suggested. \"Yeah, maybe, but if she had thought about it she would have realized\\nthat cucumbers couldn’t be right. I mean, what\\'s a patient supposed to\\ndo? Sit in bed chewing on raw cucumbers? Hey, Daddy, want a\\ncucumber?\" <No> said Midori\\'s father. Midori sat by the head of the bed, telling her father snippets of news\\nfrom home. The TV picture had gone fuzzy and she had called the\\nrepairman; their aunt from Takaido would visit in a few days; the\\nchemist, Mr Miyawaki, had fallen off his bike: stuff like that. Her\\nfather responded with grunts. \"Are you sure you don\\'t want anything to eat?\" <No> her father answered. \"How about you, Watanabe? Some grapefruit?\" \"No,\" I answered. A few minutes later, Midori took me to the TV room and smoked a\\ncigarette on the sofa. Three patients in pyjamas were also smoking\\nthere and watching some kind of political discussion programme. \"Hey,\" whispered Midori with a twinkle in her eye. \"That old guy with\\nthe crutches has been looking at my legs ever since we came in. The\\none with glasses in the blue pyjamas.\" \"What do you expect, wearing a skirt like that?\" \"It\\'s nice, though. I bet they\\'re all bored. It probably does them good.\\nMaybe the excitement helps them get better faster.\" \"As long as it doesn\\'t have the opposite effect.\" Midori stared at the smoke rising from her cigarette. \"You know,\" she said, \"my father\\'s not such a bad guy. I get angry\\nwith him sometimes because he says terrible things, but deep down\\nhe\\'s honest and he really loved my mother. In his own way, he\\'s lived\\nlife with all the intensity he could muster. He\\'s a little weak, maybe,\\nand he has absolutely no head for business, and people don\\'t like him\\nvery much, but he\\'s a hell of a lot better than the cheats and liars who\\ngo round smoothing things over because they\\'re so slick. I\\'m as bad as\\nhe is about not backing down once I\\'ve said something, so we fight a\\nlot, but really, he\\'s not a bad guy.\" Midori took my hand as if she were picking up something someone\\nhad dropped in the street, and placed it on her lap. Half my hand lay\\non the skirt, the rest touching her thigh. She looked into my eyes for\\nsome time. \"Sorry to bring you to a place like this,\" she said, \"but would\\nyou\\n mind staying with me a little longer?\" \"I\\'ll stay with you all day if you want,\" I said. \"Until five.\" I like\\nspending time with you, and I\\'ve got nothing else to do.\" \"How do you usually spend your Sundays?\" \"Doing my laundry,\" I said. \"And ironing.\" \"I don\\'t suppose you want to tell me too much about her ... your\\ngirlfriend?\" \"No, I guess not. It\\'s complicated, and I, kind of, don\\'t think I could\\nexplain it very well.\" \"That\\'s OK. You don\\'t have to explain anything,\" said Midori. \"But do\\nyou mind if I tell you what I imagine is going on?\" \"No, go ahead. I suspect anything you’d imagine would have to be\\ninteresting.\" \"I think she\\'s a married woman.\" \"You do?\" \"Yeah, she\\'s thirty-two or -three and she\\'s rich and beautiful and she\\nwears fur coats and Charles Jourdan shoes and silk underwear and\\nshe\\'s hungry for sex and she likes to do really yucky things. The two\\nof you meet on weekday afternoons and devour each other\\'s bodies.\\nBut her husband\\'s home on Sundays, so she can\\'t see you. Am I\\nright?\" \"Very, very interesting.\" \"She has you tie her up and blindfold her and lick every square inch of\\nher body. Then she makes you put weird things inside her and she gets\\ninto these incredible positions like a contortionist and you take\\npictures of her with a Polaroid camera.\" \"Sounds like fun.\" \"She\\'s dying for it all the time, so she does everything she can think\\nof. And she thinks about it every day. She\\'s got nothing but free time,\\nso she\\'s always planning: Hmm, next time Watanabe comes, we\\'ll do\\nthis, or we\\'ll do that. You get in bed and she goes crazy, trying all\\nthese positions and coming three times in each one. And she says to\\nyou, \"Don\\'t I have a sensational body? You can\\'t be satisfied with\\nyoung girls any more. Young girls won\\'t do \\nthis\\n for you, will they? Or\\nthis.\\n Feel good? But don\\'t come yet!\"\\' \"You\\'ve watched too many porno movies,\" I said with a laugh. \"You think so? I was kind of worried about that. But \\nI love\\nporn films. Take me to one next time, OK?\" \"Fine,\" I said. \"Next time you\\'re free.\" \"Really? I can hardly wait. Let\\'s go to a real S&M one, with whips\\nand, like, they make the girl pee in front of everyone. That\\'s my favourite.\" \"We’ll do it.\" \"You know what I like best about porn cinemas?\" \"I couldn’t begin to\\nguess.\" \"Whenever a sex scene starts, you can hear this \"Gulp!\\' sound when\\neverybody swallows all at once,\" said Midori. \"I \\nlove\\n that \"Gulp!\\' It\\'s\\nso sweet!\" Back in the hospital room, Midori aimed a stream of talk at her father\\nagain, and he would either grunt in response or say nothing. Around\\neleven the wife of the man in the other bed came to change her\\nhusband\\'s pyjamas and peel fruit for him and so on. She had a round\\nface and seemed like a nice person, and she and Midori shared a lot of\\nsmall talk. A nurse showed up with a new intravenous drip and talked\\na little while with Midori and the wife before she left. I let my eyes\\nwander around the room and out the window to the power lines.\\nSparrows would turn up every now and then and perch on them.\\nMidori talked to her father and wiped the sweat from his brow and\\nhelped him spit phlegm into a tissue and chatted with the\\nneighbouring patient\\'s wife and the nurse and sent an occasional\\nremark my way and checked the intravenous contraption. The doctor did his rounds at 11.30, so Midori and I stepped outside to\\nwait in the corridor. When he came out, Midori asked him how her\\nfather was doing. \"Well, he\\'s just come out of surgery, and we\\'ve got him on painkillers\\nso, well, he\\'s pretty drained,\" said the doctor. \"I\\'ll need another two or\\nthree days to evaluate the results of the operation. If it went well, he\\'ll\\nbe OK, and if it didn\\'t, we’ll have to make some decisions at that\\npoint.\" \"You’re not going to open his head up again, are you?\" \"I really can\\'t say until the time comes,\" said the doctor. \"Wow, that\\'s\\nsome short skirt you\\'re wearing!\" \"Nice, huh?\" \"What do you do on stairways?\" the doctor asked. \"Nothing special. I let it all hang out,\" said Midori. The nurse\\nchuckled behind the doctor. \"Incredible. You ought to come and let us open \\nyour\\n head one of these\\ndays to see what\\'s going on in there. Do me a favour and use the lifts\\nwhile you\\'re in the hospital. I can\\'t afford to have any more patients.\\nI\\'m way too busy as it is.\" Soon after the doctor\\'s rounds it was lunchtime. A nurse was\\ncirculating from room to room pushing a trolley loaded with meals.\\nMidori\\'s father was given pottage, fruit, boiled, deboned fish, and\\nvegetables that had been ground into some kind of jelly. Midori turned\\nhim on his back and raised him up using the handle at the foot of the\\nbed. She fed him the soup with a spoon. After five or six swallows, he\\nturned his face aside and said (No more>. You\\'ve got to eat at least this much.\" Midori san <Later> he said.\\n\"You\\'re hopeless - if you don\\'t eat properly, you\\'ll never get your\\nstrength back,\" she said. \"Don\\'t you have to pee yet?\" <No> he said.\\n\"Hey, Watanabe, let\\'s go down to the cafeteria.\" I agreed to go, but in fact I didn’t much feel like eating. The cafeteria\\nwas packed with doctors, nurses and visitors. Long lines of chairs and\\ntables filled the huge, windowless underground cavern where every\\nmouth seemed to be eating or talking - about sickness, no doubt, the\\nvoices echoing and re-echoing as in a tunnel. Now and then the PA\\nsystem would break through the reverberation with calls for a doctor\\nor nurse. While I laid claim to a table, Midori bought two set meals\\nand carried them over on an aluminium tray. Croquettes with cream\\nsauce, potato salad, shredded cabbage, boiled vegetables, rice and\\nmiso soup: these were lined up in the tray in the same white plastic\\ndishes they used for patients. I ate about half of mine and left the rest. Midori seemed to enjoy her meal to the last mouthful. \"Not hungry?\" she asked, sipping hot tea. \"Not really,\" I said. \"It\\'s the hospital,\" she said, scanning the cafeteria. \"This always\\nhappens when people aren\\'t used to the place. The smells, the sounds,\\nthe stale air, patients\\' faces, stress, irritation, disappointment, pain,\\nfatigue - that\\'s what does it. It grabs you in the stomach and kills your\\nappetite. Once you get used to it, though, it\\'s no problem at all. Plus,\\nyou can\\'t really take care of a sick person unless you eat properly. It\\'s\\ntrue. I know what I\\'m talking about because I\\'ve done it with my\\ngrandfather, my grandmother, my mother, and now my father. You\\nnever know when you\\'re going to have to , so its important to eat\\nwhen you can \"I see what you mean,\" I said. \"Relatives come to visit and they eat with me here, and they always\\nleave half their food, just like you. And they always say, \"Oh, Midori,\\nit\\'s wonderful you\\'ve got such a healthy appetite. I\\'m too upset to eat.\\'\\nBut get serious, I\\'m the one who\\'s actually here taking care of the\\npatient! They just have to drop by and show a little sympathy. \\nI\\'m\\n the\\none who wipes up the shit and collects the phlegm and mops the\\nbrows. If sympathy was all it took to clean up shit, I\\'d have 50 times\\nas much sympathy as anybody else! Instead, they see me eating all my\\nfood and they give me this look and say, \"Oh Midori, you\\'ve got such\\na healthy appetite.\\' What do they think I am, a donkey pulling a cart?\\nThey\\'re old enough to know how the world really works, so why are\\nthey so stupid? It’s easy to talk big, but the important thing is whether\\nor not you clean up the shit. I can be hurt, you know. I can get as\\nexhausted as anyone else. I can feel so bad I want to cry, too. I mean,\\nyou\\n try watching a gang of doctors get together and cut open\\nsomebody\\'s head when there\\'s no hope of saving them, and stirring\\nthings up in there, and doing it again and again, and every time they\\ndo it it makes the person worse and a little bit crazier, and see how\\nyou like it! And on top of it, you see your savings disappear. I don’t know if I can keep going to university for another three-and-a-half\\nyears, and there\\'s no way my sister can afford a wedding ceremony at\\nthis rate.\" \"How many days a week do you come here?\" I asked. \"Usually four,\" said Midori. \"This place claims to offer total nursing\\ncare, and the nurses are great, but there\\'s just too much for them to do.\\nSome member of the family has to be around to take up the slack. My\\nsister\\'s watching the shop, and I\\'ve got my studies. Still, she manages\\nto get here three days a week, and I come four. And we sneak in every\\nnow and then. Believe me, it\\'s a full schedule!\" \"How can you spend time with me if you\\'re so busy?\" \"I like spending time with you,\" said Midori, playing with a plastic\\ncup. \"Get out of here for a couple of hours and go for a walk,\" I said. \"I\\'ll\\ntake care of your father for a while.\" \"Why?\" \"You need to get away from the hospital and relax by yourself - not\\ntalk to anybody, just clear your mind.\" Midori thought about it for a minute and nodded. \"Hmm, you may be\\nright. But do you know what to do? How to take care of him?\" \"I\\'ve been watching. I\\'ve pretty much got it. You check the\\nintravenous thing, give him water, wipe the sweat off, and help him\\nspit phlegm. The bedpan\\'s under the bed, and if he gets hungry I feed\\nhim the rest of his lunch. Anything I can\\'t work out I\\'ll ask the nurse.\" \"I think that should do it,\" said Midori with a smile. \"There\\'s just one\\nthing, though. He\\'s starting to get a little funny in the head, so he says\\nweird things once in a while - things that nobody can understand.\\nDon\\'t let it bother you if\\nhe does that.\" \"I\\'ll be fine,\" I said. Back in the room, Midori told her father she had some business to take\\ncare of and that I would be watching him while she was out. He seemed to have nothing to say to this. It might have meant nothing to\\nhim. He just lay there on his back, staring at the ceiling. If he hadn\\'t\\nbeen blinking every once in a while, he could have passed for dead.\\nHis eyes were bloodshot as if he had been drinking, and each time he\\ntook a deep breath his nostrils flared a little. Other than that, he didn’t move\\na muscle, and made no effort to reply to Midori. I couldn’t begin to\\ngrasp what he might be thinking or feeling in the murky depths of his\\nconsciousness. After Midori left, I thought I might try speaking to her father, but I\\nhad no idea what to say to him or how to say it, so I just kept quiet.\\nBefore long, he closed his eyes and went to sleep. I sat on the stool by\\nthe head of the bed and studied the occasional twitching of his nose,\\nhoping all the while that he wouldn\\'t die now. How strange it would\\nbe, I thought, if this man were to breathe his last with me by his side.\\nAfter all, I had just met him for the first time in my life, and the only\\nthing binding us together was Midori, a girl I happened to know from\\nmy History of Drama class. He was not dying, though, just sleeping peacefully. Bringing my ear\\nclose to his face, I could hear his faint breathing. I relaxed and chatted\\nto the wife of the man in the next bed. She talked of nothing but\\nMidori, assuming I was her boyfriend. \"She’s a really wonderful girl,\" she said. \"She takes great care of her\\nfather; she’s kind and gentle and sensitive and solid, and on top of all\\nthat, she’s pretty. You\\'d better treat her right. Don’t ever let her go.\\nYou won’t find another one like her.\" \"I’ll treat her right,\" I said without elaborating. \"I have a son and daughter at home. He’s 17, she’s 21, and neither of\\nthem would ever think of coming to the hospital. The minute school\\nfinishes, they\\'re off surfing or dating or whatever. They\\'re terrible.\\nThey squeeze me for all the pocket money they can get and then they\\ndisappear.\" At 1.30 she left the hospital to do some shopping. Both men were\\nsound asleep. Gentle afternoon sunlight flooded the room, and I felt as\\nthough I might drift off at any moment perching on my stool. Yellow\\nand white chrysanthemums in a vase on the table by the window\\nreminded people it was autumn. In the air floated the sweet smell of\\nboiled fish left over from lunch. The nurses continued to clip-clop up\\nand down the hall, talking to each other in clear, penetrating voices.\\nThey would peep into the room now and then and flash me a smile\\nwhen they saw that both patients were sleeping. I wished I had\\nsomething to read, but there were no books or magazines or\\nnewspapers in the room, just a calendar on the wall. I thought about Naoko. I thought about her naked, wearing only her\\nhairslide. I thought about the curve of her waist and the dark shadow\\nof her pubic hair. Why had she shown herself to me like that? Had she\\nbeen sleep-walking? Or was it just a fantasy of mine? As time went by\\nand that little world receded into the distance, I grew increasingly\\nuncertain whether the events of that night had actually happened. If I\\ntold myself they were real, I believed they were, and if I told myself\\nthey were a fantasy, they seemed like a fantasy. They were too clear\\nand detailed to have been a fantasy, and too whole and beautiful to\\nhave been real: Naoko\\'s body and the moonlight. Midori\\'s father woke suddenly and started coughing, which put a stop\\nto my daydreaming. I helped him spit his phlegm into a tissue, and\\nwiped the sweat from his brow with a towel. \"Would you like some water?\" I asked, to which he gave a four-\\nmillimetre nod. I held the small glass water bottle so that he could sip\\na little bit at a time, dry lips trembling, throat twitching. He drank\\nevery bit of the lukewarm water in the bottle. \"Would you like some more?\" I asked. He seemed to be trying to\\nspeak, so I brought my ear closer. cThat\\'s enough> he said in a small, dry voice - a voice even smaller\\nand dryer than before. \"Why don\\'t you eat something? You must be hungry.\" He answered\\nwith a slight nod. As Midori had done, I cranked his bed up and\\nstarted feeding him alternating spoonfuls of vegetable jelly and boiled\\nfish. It took an incredibly long time to get through half his food, at\\nwhich point he shook his head a little to signal he had had enough.\\nThe movement was almost imperceptible; it apparently hurt him to\\nmake larger gestures. \"What about the fruit?\" I asked him. <No> he said. I wiped the corners of his mouth with a towel and made\\nthe bed level again before taking the dishes to the corridor. \"Was that good?\" I asked him. <Awful> he answered. \"Yeah,\" I said with a smile. \"It looked pretty bad.\" Midori\\'s father\\ncould not seem to decide whether to open his eyes further or close\\nthem as he lay there silently, staring at me. I wondered if he knew who\\nI was. He seemed more relaxed when alone with me than when Midori\\nwas around. He had probably mistaken me for someone else. Or at\\nleast that was how I preferred to think of it. \"Beautiful day out there,\" I said, perching on the stool and crossing\\nmy legs. \"It’s autumn, Sunday, great weather, and crowded\\neverywhere you go. Relaxing indoors like this is the best thing you\\ncan do on such a nice day. It’s exhausting in those crowds. And the air\\nis bad. I mostly do laundry on Sundays - wash the stuff in the\\nmorning, hang it out on the roof of my dorm, take it in before the sun\\ngoes down, do a good job of ironing it. I don’t mind ironing at all.\\nThere’s a special satisfaction in making wrinkled things smooth. And\\nI’m pretty good at it, too. Of course I was terrible at it at first. I put\\ncreases in everything. After a month of practice, though, I knew what\\nI was doing. So Sunday is my day for laundry and ironing. I couldn\\'t\\ndo it today, of course. Too bad: wasted a perfect laundry day. \"That’s OK, though. I’ll wake up early and take care of it tomorrow.\\nDon’t worry. I’ve got nothing else to do on a Sunday. \"After I do my laundry tomorrow morning and hang it out to dry. I\\'ll\\ngo to my ten o\\'clock class. It\\'s the one I\\'m in with Midori: History of\\nDrama. I\\'m working on Euripides. Are you familiar with Euripides?\\nHe was an ancient Greek - one of the \"Big Three\\' of Greek tragedy\\nalong with Aeschylus and Sophocles. He supposedly died when a dog\\nbit him in Macedonia, but not everybody believes this. Anyway, that\\'s\\nEuripides. I like Sophocles better, but I suppose it\\'s a matter of taste. I\\nreally can\\'t say which is better. \"What marks his plays is the way things get so mixed up the\\ncharacters are trapped. Do you see what I mean? Lots of different\\npeople appear, and they all have their own situations and reasons and\\nexcuses, and each one is pursuing his or her own idea of justice or\\nhappiness. As a result, nobody can do anything. Obviously. I mean,\\nit\\'s basically impossible for \\neverybody\\'s\\n justice to prevail or\\neverybody\\'s\\n happiness to triumph, so chaos takes over. And then what\\ndo you think happens? Simple - a god appears at the end and starts\\ndirecting the traffic. \\n\"You\\n go over \\nthere,\\n and \\nyou\\n come \\nhere,\\n and \\nyou\\nget together with \\nher,\\n and you just sit still for while.\\' Like that. He\\'s a\\nkind of fixer, and in the end everything works out perfectly. They call\\nthis \\n\\'deus ex machina\\'.\\n There\\'s almost always \\na deus ex machina\\n in\\nEuripides, and that\\'s where critical opinion divides over him. \"But think about it - what if there were \\na deus ex machina\\n in real life?\\nEverything would be so easy! If you felt stuck or trapped, some god\\nwould swing down from up there and solve all your problems. What\\ncould be easier than that? Anyway, that\\'s History of Drama. This is\\nmore or less the kind of stuff we study at university.\" Midori\\'s father said nothing, but he kept his vacant eyes on me the\\nwhole time I was talking. Of course, I couldn\\'t tell from those eyes\\nwhether he understood anything I was saying. \"Peace,\" I said. After all that talk, I felt starved. I had had next to nothing for breakfast\\nand had eaten only half my lunch. Now I was sorry I hadn\\'t eaten more at lunch, but feeling sorry wasn\\'t going to help. I looked in a\\ncabinet for something to eat, but found only a can of nori, some Vicks\\ncough drops and soy sauce. The paper bag was still there with the\\ncucumbers and grapefruit. \"I\\'m going to eat some cucumbers if you don’t mind,\" I said to\\nMidori\\'s father. He didn’t answer. I washed three cucumbers in the\\nsink and dribbled a little soy sauce into a dish. Then I wrapped a\\ncucumber in nori, dipped it in soy sauce and gobbled it down. \"Mmm, great!\" I said to Midori\\'s father. \"Fresh, simple, smells like\\nlife. Really good cucumbers. A far more sensible food than kiwi\\nfruit.\" I polished off one cucumber and attacked the next. The sickroom\\nechoed with the sound of me munching cucumbers. Only after I had\\nfinished the second whole cucumber was I ready to take a break. I\\nboiled some water on the gas burner in the hall and made tea. \"Would you like something to drink? Water? Juice?\" I asked Midori\\'s\\nfather. <Cucumber> he said. \"Great,\" I said with a smile. \"With nori?\" He gave a little nod. I cranked the bed up again. Then I cut a bite-\\nsized piece of cucumber, wrapped it with a strip of nori, stabbed the\\ncombination with a toothpick, dipped it in soy sauce, and delivered it\\nto the patient\\'s waiting mouth. With almost no change of expression,\\nMidori\\'s father crunched down on the piece again and again and\\nfinally swallowed it. \"How was that? Good, huh?\" <Good> he said. \"It\\'s good when food tastes good,\" I said. \"It\\'s kind of like proof you\\'re\\nalive.\" He ended up eating the entire cucumber. When he had finished it, he\\nwanted water, so I gave him a drink from the bottle. A few minutes\\nlater, he said he needed to pee, so I took the urine jar from under the bed and held it by the tip of his penis. Afterwards I emptied the jar\\ninto the toilet and washed it out. Then I went back to the sickroom and\\nfinished my tea. \"How are you feeling?\" I asked. <My.... head> he said. \"Hurts?\" <A little> he said with a slight frown. \"Well, no wonder, you\\'ve just had an operation. Of course. I\\'ve never\\nhad one, so I don\\'t know what it\\'s like.\" <Ticket> he said. \"Ticket? What ticket?\" <Midori> he said. <Ticket>. I had no idea what he was talking about, and just kept quiet. He stayed\\nsilent for a time, too. Then he seemed to say <Please>. He opened his\\neyes wide and looked at me hard. I guessed that he was trying to tell\\nme something, but I couldn\\'t begin to imagine what it was. <Ueno> he said. <Midori>. \"Ueno Station?\" He gave a little nod. I tried to summarize what he was getting at: \"Ticket, Midori, please,\\nUeno Station,\" but I had no idea what it meant. I assumed his mind\\nwas muddled, but compared with before his eyes now had a terrible\\nclarity. He raised the arm that was free of the intravenous contraption\\nand stretched it towards me. This must have been a major effort for\\nhim, the way the hand trembled in mid-air. I stood and grasped his\\nfrail, wrinkled hand. He returned my grasp with what little strength he\\ncould muster and said again <Please>. \"Don\\'t worry,\" I said. \"I\\'ll take care of the ticket and Midori, too.\" He\\nlet his hand drop back to the bed and closed his eyes. Then, with a\\nloud rush of breath, he fell asleep. I checked to make sure he was still\\nalive, then went out to boil more water for tea. As I was sipping the\\nhot liquid, I realized that I had developed a kind of liking for this little\\nman on the verge of death. The wife of the other patient came back a few minutes later and asked\\nif everything was OK. I assured her it was. Her husband, too, was\\nsound asleep, breathing deeply. Midori came back after three. \"I was in the park, spacing out,\" she said. \"I did what you told me,\\ndidn\\'t talk to anybody, just let my head go empty.\" \"How was it?\" \"Thanks, I feel much better. I still have that draggy, tired feeling, but\\nmy body feels much lighter than before. I guess I was more tired than\\nI realized.\" With her father sound asleep, there was nothing for us to do, so we\\nbought coffee from a vending machine and drank it in the TV room. I\\nreported to Midori on what had happened in her absence - that her\\nfather had had a good sleep, then woke up and ate some of what was\\nleft of his lunch, then saw me eating a cucumber and asked for one\\nhimself, ate the whole thing and peed. \"Watanabe, you\\'re amazing,\" said Midori. \"We\\'re all going crazy\\ntrying to get him to eat anything, and you got him to eat a whole\\ncucumber! Incredible!\" \"I don\\'t know, I think he just saw me enjoying my own cucumber.\" \"Or maybe you just have this knack for relaxing people.\" \"No way,\" I\\nsaid with a laugh. \"A lot of people will tell you just the opposite about\\nme.\" \"What do you think about my father?\" \"I like him. Not that we had all that much to say to each\\nother. But, I don\\'t know, he seems nice.\" \"Was he quiet?\" \"Very.\" \"You should have seen him a week ago. He was awful,\" Midori said,\\nshaking her head. \"Kind of lost his marbles and went wild. Threw a\\nglass at me and yelled terrible stuff - T hope you die, you stupid bitch!\\'\\nThis sickness can do that to people. They don\\'t know why, but it can make people get really vicious all of a sudden. It was the same with\\nmy mother. What do you think she said to me? \"You\\'re not my\\ndaughter! I hate your guts!\\' The whole world turned black for me for a\\nsecond when she said that. But that kind of thing is one of the features\\nof this particular sickness. Something presses on a part of the brain\\nand makes people say all kinds of nasty things. You know it\\'s just part\\nof the sickness, but still, it hurts. What do you expect? Here I am,\\nworking my fingers to the bone for them, and they\\'re saying all this\\nterrible stuff to me-\" \"I know what you mean,\" I said. Then I remembered the strange\\nfragments that Midori\\'s father had mumbled to me. \"Ticket? Ueno Station?\" Midori said. \"I wonder what that\\'s all about?\"\\n\"And then he said. \\nPlease,\\n and \\nMidori.\",\\n \"Please take care of\\nMidori?\"\\' \"Or maybe he wants you to go to Ueno and buy a ticket. The order of\\nthe four words is such a mess, who knows what he means? Does Ueno\\nStation mean anything special to you?\" \"Hmm, Ueno Station.\" Midori thought about it for a while. \"The only\\nthing I can think of is the two times I ran away, when I was eight and\\nwhen I was ten. Both times I took a train from Ueno to Fukushima.\\nBought the tickets with money I took from the till. Somebody at home\\nmade me really angry, and I did it to get even. I had an aunt in\\nFukushima, I kind of liked her, so I went to her house. My father was\\nthe one who brought me home. Came all the way to Fukushima to get\\nme - a hundred miles! We ate boxed lunches on the train to Ueno. My\\nfather told me all kinds of stuff while we were travelling, just little bits\\nand pieces with long spaces in between. Like about the big earthquake\\nof 1923 or about the war or about the time I was born, stuff he didn\\'t\\nusually talk about. Come to think of it, those were the only times my\\nfather and I had something like a good, long talk, just the two of us.\\nHey, can you believe this? - my father was smack bang in the middle\\nof Tokyo during one of the biggest earthquakes in history and he didn\\'t even notice it!\" \"No way!\" \"It’s true! He was riding through Koishikawa with a cart on the back\\nof his bike, and he didn’t feel a thing. When he got home, all the tiles\\nhad fallen off the roofs in the neighbourhood, and everyone in the\\nfamily was hugging pillars and quaking in their boots. He still didn\\'t\\nget it and. the way he tells it, he asked, \"What the hell\\'s going on\\nhere?\\' That\\'s my father\\'s \"fond recollection\\' of the Great Kanto\\nEarthquake!\" Midori laughed. \"All his stories of the old days are like\\nthat. No drama whatsoever. They\\'re all just a little bit off-centre. I\\ndon\\'t know, when he tells those stories, you kind of get the feeling like\\nnothing important has happened in Japan for the past 50 or 60 years.\\nThe young officers\\' uprising of 1936, the Pacific War, they\\'re all kind\\nof \"Oh yeah, now that you mention it, I guess something like that once\\nhappened\\' kind of things. It\\'s so funny! \"So, anyway, on the train, he\\'d tell me these stories in bits and pieces\\nwhile we were riding from Fukushima to Ueno. And at the end, he\\'d\\nalways say, \"So that goes to show you, Midori, it\\'s the same wherever\\nyou go.\\' I was young enough to be impressed by stuff like that.\" \"So is that \\nyour\\n \"fond recollection\\' of Ueno Station?\" I asked. \"Yeah,\"\\nsaid Midori. \"Did you ever run away from home, Watanabe?\" \"Never.\" \"Why not?\" \"Lack of imagination. It never occurred to me to run away.\" \"You are\\nso \\nweird!\"\\n Midori said, cocking her head as though truly impressed. \"I wonder,\" I said. \"Well, anyway, I think my father was trying to say he wanted you to\\nlook after me.\" \"Really?\" \"Really! I understand things like that. Intuitively. So tell me, what was\\nyour answer to him?\" \"Well, I didn\\'t understand what he was saying, so I just said OK. don’t worry. I\\'d take care of both you and the ticket.\" \"You promised my father that? You said you’d take care of me?\" She looked me straight in the eye with a dead-serious expression on her face. \"Not like \\nthat,\" I\\n hastened to correct her. \"I really didn’t know \\nwhat\\n he\\nwas saying, and -\" \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'m just kidding.\" she said with a smile. \"I love that\\nabout you.\" Midori and I finished our coffee and went back to the room. Her father\\nwas still sound asleep. If you leaned close you could hear his steady\\nbreathing. As the afternoon deepened, the light outside the hospital\\nwindow changed to the soft, gentle colour of autumn. A flock of birds\\nrested on the electric wire outside, then flew on. Midori and I sat in a\\ncorner of the room, talking quietly the whole time. She read my palm\\nand predicted that I would live to 105, marry three times, and die in a\\ntraffic accident. \"Not a bad life,\" I said. When her father woke just after four o\\'clock, Midori went to sit by his\\npillow, wiped the sweat from his brow, gave him water, and asked\\nhim about the pain in his head. A nurse came and took his\\ntemperature, recorded the number of his urinations, and checked the\\nintravenous equipment. I went to the TV room and watched a little\\nfootball. At five I told Midori I would be leaving. To her father I explained, \"I\\nhave to go to work now. I sell records in Shinjuku from six to 10.30.\"\\nHe turned his eyes to me and gave a little nod. \"Hey, Watanabe, I don\\'t know how to put this, but \\nI really\\n want to\\nthank you for today,\" Midori said to me when she saw me to\\nreception. \"I didn’t do that much,\" I said. \"But if I can be of any help. I\\'ll come\\nnext week, too. I\\'d like to see your father again.\" \"Really?\" \"Well, there\\'s not that much for me to do in the dorm, and if I come here I get to eat cucumbers.\" Midori folded her arms and tapped the linoleum with the heel of her\\nshoe. \"I\\'d like to go drinking with you again,\" she said, cocking her head\\nslightly. \"How about the porno movies?\" \"We\\'ll do that first and \\nthen\\n go drinking. And we\\'ll talk about all the\\nusual disgusting things.\" \"I\\'m\\n not the one who talks about disgusting things,\" I protested. \"It\\'s\\nyou.\" \"Anyway, we\\'ll talk about things like that and get plastered and go to\\nbed.\" \"And you know what happens next,\" I said with a sigh. \"I try to do it,\\nand you don’t let me. Right?\" She laughed through her nose. \"Anyway,\" I said, \"pick me up again next Sunday morning. We\\'ll\\ncome here together.\" \"With me in a little longer skirt?\" \"Definitely,\" I said. I didn\\'t go to the hospital that next Sunday, though. Midori\\'s father\\ndied on Friday morning. She called at 6.30 in the morning to tell me that. The buzzer letting me\\nknow I had a phone call went off and I ran down to the lobby with a\\ncardigan thrown over my pyjamas. A cold rain was falling silently. \"My father died a few minutes ago,\" Midori said in a small, quiet\\nvoice. I asked her if there was anything I could do. \"Thanks,\" she said.\\n\"There\\'s really nothing. We\\'re used to funerals. I just wanted to let you\\nknow.\" A kind of sigh escaped her lips. \"Don\\'t come to the funeral, OK? I hate stuff like that. I don\\'t want to\\nsee you there.\" \"I get it,\" I said. \"Will you really take me to a pomo movie?\" \"Of course I will.\" \"A really disgusting one.\" \"I\\'ll research the matter thoroughly.\" \"Good. I\\'ll call you,\" she said and\\nhung up. A week went by without a word from Midori. No calls, no sign of her\\nin the lecture hall. I kept hoping for a message from her whenever I\\nwent back to the dorm, but there were never any. One night, I tried to\\nkeep my promise by thinking of her when I masturbated, but it didn’t\\nwork. I tried switching over to Naoko, but not even Naoko\\'s image\\nwas any help that time. It seemed so ridiculous I gave up. I took a\\nswig of whisky, brushed my teeth and went to bed. I wrote a letter to Naoko on Sunday morning. One thing I told her\\nabout was Midori\\'s father. \\nI went to the hospital to visit the father of a\\ngirl in one of my lectures and ate some cucumbers in his room. When\\nhe heard me crunching on them, he wanted some too, and he ate his\\nwith the same crunching sound. Five days later, though, he died. I still\\nhave a vivid memory of the tiny crunching he made when he chewed\\nhis pieces of cucumber. People leave strange, little memories of\\nthemselves behind when they die.\\n My letter went on: I think of you and Reiko and the aviary while I lie in bed after waking\\nup in the morning. I think about the peacock and pigeons and parrots\\nand turkeys - and about the rabbits. I remember the yellow raincapes\\nyou and Reiko wore with the hoods up that rainy morning. It feels\\ngood to think about you when I’m warm in bed. I feel as if you\\'re\\ncurled up there beside me, fast asleep. And I think how great it would\\nbe if it were true. I miss you terribly sometimes, but in general I go on living with all the\\nenergy I can muster. Just as you take care of the birds and the fields\\nevery morning, every morning I wind my own spring. I give it some 36 good twists by the time I\\'ve got up, brushed my teeth, shaved, eaten\\nbreakfast, changed my clothes, left the dorm, and arrived at the\\nuniversity. I tell myself, \"OK. let\\'s make this day another good one.\" I\\nhadn\\'t noticed before, but they tell me I talk to myself a lot these days.\\nProbably mumbling to myself while I wind my spring. It\\'s hard not being able to see you, but my life in Tokyo would be a lot\\nworse if it weren\\'t for you. It\\'s because I think of you when I\\'m in bed\\nin the morning that I can wind my spring and tell myself I have to live\\nanother good day. I know I have to give it my best here just as you are\\ndoing there. Today\\'s Sunday, though, a day I don\\'t wind my spring. I\\'ve done my\\nlaundry, and now I\\'m in my room, writing to you. Once I\\'ve finished\\nthis letter and put a stamp on it and dropped it into the postbox, there\\'s\\nnothing for me to do until the sun goes down. I don’t study on\\nSundays, either. I do a good enough job on weekdays studying in the\\nlibrary between lectures, so I don’t have anything left to do on\\nSundays. Sunday afternoons are quiet, peaceful and. for me, lonely. I\\nread books or listen to music. Sometimes I think back on the different\\nroutes we used to take in our Sunday walks around Tokyo. I can \\ncome\\nup with a pretty clear picture of the clothes you were wearing on any\\nparticular walk. I remember all kinds of things on Sunday afternoons.\\nSay \"Hi\" from me to Reiko. I really miss her guitar at night. When I had finished the letter, I walked a couple of blocks to a\\npostbox, then bought an egg sandwich and a Coke at a nearby bakery.\\nI had these for lunch while I sat on a bench and watched some boys\\nplaying baseball in a local playground. The deepening of autumn had\\nbrought an increased blueness and depth to the sky. I glanced up to\\nfind two vapour trails heading off to the west in perfect parallel like\\ntram tracks. A foul ball came rolling my way, and when I threw it\\nback to them the young players doffed their caps with a polite \"Thank\\nyou, sir\". As in most junior baseball, there were lots of walks and stolen bases. After noon I went back to my room to read but couldn’t concentrate.\\nInstead I found myself staring at the ceiling and thinking about\\nMidori. I wondered if her father had really been trying to ask me to\\nlook after her when he was gone, but I had no way of telling what had\\nbeen on his mind. He had probably confused me with somebody else.\\nIn any case, he had died on a Friday morning when a cold rain was\\nfalling, and now it was impossible to know the truth. I imagined that,\\nin death, he had shrivelled up smaller than ever. And then they had\\nburned him in an oven until he was nothing but ashes. And what had\\nhe left behind? A nothing-much bookshop in a nothing-much\\nneighbourhood and two daughters, at least one of whom was more\\nthan a little strange. What kind of life was that? I wondered. Lying in\\nthat hospital bed with his cut-open head and his muddled brain, what\\nhad been on his mind as he looked at me? Thinking thoughts like this about Midori\\'s father put me into such a\\nmiserable mood that I had to bring the laundry down from the roof\\nbefore it was really diy and set off for Shinjuku to kill time walking\\nthe streets. The Sunday crowds gave me some relief. The Kinokuniya\\nbookshop was as jampacked as a rush-hour train. I bought a copy of\\nFaulkner\\'s \\nLight in August\\n and went to the noisiest jazz cafe I could\\nthink of, reading my new book while listening to Ornette Coleman and\\nBud Powell and drinking hot, thick, foul-tasting coffee. At 5.30 I\\nclosed my book, went outside and ate a light supper. How many\\nSundays - how many hundreds of Sundays like this - lay ahead of me?\\n\"Quiet, peaceful, and lonely,\" I said aloud to myself. On Sundays, I\\ndidn\\'t wind my spring. \\n \\n \\n \\n Halfway through that week I managed to cut my palm open on a piece\\nof broken glass. I hadn\\'t noticed that one of the glass partitions in a\\nrecord shelf was cracked. I could hardly believe how much blood\\ngushed out of me, turning the floor bright red at my feet. The shop\\nmanager found some towels and tied them tightly around the wound.\\nThen he made a phone call to casualty. He was a pretty useless guy\\nmost of the time, but he acted with surprising efficiency. The hospital\\nwas nearby, fortunately, but by the time I got there the towels were\\nsoaked in red, and the blood they couldn\\'t soak up had been dripping\\non the tarmac. People scurried out of the way for me. They seemed to\\nthink I had been injured in a fight. I felt no pain to speak of, but the\\nblood wouldn\\'t stop. The doctor was cool as he removed the blood-soaked towels, stopped\\nthe bleeding with a tourniquet on my wrist, disinfected the wound and\\nsewed it up, telling me to come again the next day. Back at the record\\nshop, the manager told me to go home: he would put me down as\\nhaving worked my shift. I took a bus to the dorm and went straight to\\nNagasawa\\'s room. With my nerves on edge over the cut, I wanted to\\ntalk to somebody, and I hadn\\'t seen Nagasawa for a long time. I found him in his room, drinking a can of beer and watching a\\nSpanish lesson on TV. \"What the hell happened to you?\" he asked\\nwhen he saw my bandage. I said I had cut myself but that it was\\nnothing much. He offered me a beer and I said no thanks. \"Just wait. This\\'ll be over in a minute,\" said Nagasawa, and he went\\non practising his Spanish pronunciation. I boiled some water and made myself a cup of tea with a tea bag. A Spanish woman recited\\nexample sentences: \"I have never seen such terrible rain!\", \"Many\\nbridges were washed away in Barcelona.\" Nagasawa read the text\\naloud in Spanish. \"What awful sentences!\" he said. \"This kind of shit\\nis all they ever give you.\" When the programme ended, he turned off the TV and took another\\nbeer from his small refrigerator. \"Are you sure I\\'m not in the way?\" I asked. \"No way. I was bored out of my mind. Sure you don’t want a beer?\"\\n\"No, I really don\\'t,\" I said. \"Oh, yeah, they posted the exam results the other day. I passed!\" \"The Foreign Ministry exam?\" \"That\\'s it. Officially, it\\'s called the \"Foreign Affairs Public Service\\nPersonnel First Class Service Examination\\'. What a joke!\"\\n\"Congratulations!\" I said and gave him my left hand to shake. \"Thanks.\" \"Of course. I\\'m not surprised you passed.\" \"No, neither am I,\" laughed Nagasawa. \"But it\\'s nice to have it\\nofficial.\" \"Think you\\'ll go abroad once you get in ?\" \"Nah, first they give you a year of training. Then they send you\\noverseas for a while.\" I sipped my tea, and he drank his beer with obvious satisfaction. \"I\\'ll give you this fridge if you\\'d like it when I get out of here,\" said\\nNagasawa. \"You’d like to have it, wouldn\\'t you? It’s great for beer.\"\\n\"Yeah, I’d like to have it, but won’t you need it? You\\'ll be living in a\\nflat or something.\" \"Don\\'t be stupid! When I get out of this place, I\\'m buying myself a big\\nfridge. I\\'m gonna live the high life! Four years in a shithole like this is\\nlong enough. I don’t want to have to \\nlook\\n at anything I used in this\\nplace. You name it. I\\'ll give it to you - the TV, the thermos flask, the\\nradio. ..\" \"I\\'ll take anything you want to give me,\" I said. I picked up the\\nSpanish textbook on his desk and stared at it. \"You\\'re starting\\nSpanish?\" \"Yeah. The more languages you know the better. And I\\'ve got a knack\\nfor them. I taught myself French and it\\'s practically perfect.\\nLanguages are like games. You learn the rules for one, and they all\\nwork the same way. Like women.\" \"Ah, the reflective life!\" I said with a sarcastic edge. \"Anyway, let\\'s eat out soon.\" \"You mean cruising for women?\" \"No, a real dinner. You, me and Hatsumi at a good restaurant. To\\ncelebrate my new job. My old man\\'s paying, so we\\'ll go somewhere\\nreally expensive.\" \"Shouldn\\'t it just be you and Hatsumi?\" \"No, it’d be better with you there. I\\'d be more comfortable, and so\\nwould Hatsumi.\" Oh no, it was Kizuki, Naoko and me all over again. \"I\\'ll spend the night at Hatsumi\\'s afterwards, so join us just for the\\nmeal.\" \"OK. if you both really want me to,\" I said. \"But, anyway, what are\\nyou planning to do about Hatsumi? You\\'ll be assigned overseas when\\nyou finish your training, and you probably won\\'t come back for years.\\nWhat\\'s going to happen to her?\" \"That\\'s her problem.\" \"I don’t get it,\" I said. Feet on his desk, Nagasawa took a swig of beer and yawned. \"Look, I’m not planning to get married. I’ve made that perfectly clear\\nto Hatsumi. If she wants to marry someone, she should go ahead and\\ndo it. I won’t stop her. If she wants to wait for me, let her wait. That’s\\nwhat I mean.\" \"I have to hand it to you,\" I said. \"You think I’m a shit, don’t you?\" \"Ido.\" \"Look, the world is an inherently unfair place. I didn’t write the rules.\\nIt\\'s always been that way. I have never once deceived Hatsumi. She\\nknows I\\'m a shit and that she can leave me whenever she decides she\\ncan\\'t take it. I told her that straight from the start.\" Nagasawa finished his beer and lit a cigarette. \"Isn\\'t there anything about life that frightens you?\" I asked. \"Hey, I\\'m not a total idiot,\" said Nagasawa. \"Of \\ncourse\\n life frightens\\nme sometimes. I don\\'t happen to take that as the premise for\\neverything else, though. I\\'m going to give it 100 per cent and go as far\\nas I can. I\\'ll take what I want and leave what I don\\'t want. That\\'s how I\\nintend to live my life, and if things go bad. I\\'ll stop and reconsider at\\nthat point. If you think about it, an unfair society is a society that\\nmakes it possible for you to exploit your abilities to the limit.\" \"Sounds like a pretty self-centred way to live,\" I said. \"Perhaps, but\\nI\\'m not just looking up at the sky and waiting for the fruit to drop. In\\nmy own way. I\\'m working hard. I\\'m working ten times harder than\\nyou are.\" \"That\\'s probably true,\" I said. \"I look around me sometimes and I get sick to my stomach. Why the\\nhell don\\'t these bastards do something? I wonder. They don\\'t do a\\nfucking thing, and then they moan about it.\" Amazed at the harshness of his tone, I looked at Nagasawa. \"The way\\nI see it, people \\nare\\n working hard. They\\'re working their fingers to the\\nbone. Or am I looking at things wrong?\" \"That\\'s not hard work. It\\'s just manual labour,\" Nagasawa said with\\nfinality. \"The \"hard work\\' I\\'m talking about is more self-directed and\\npurposeful.\" \"You mean, like studying Spanish while everyone else is taking it\\neasy?\" \"That\\'s it. I\\'m going to have Spanish mastered by next spring. I\\'ve got\\nEnglish and German and French down pat, and I\\'m almost there with Italian. You think things like that happen without hard work?\"\\nNagasawa puffed on his cigarette while I thought about Midori\\'s\\nfather. There was one man who had probably never even thought\\nabout starting Spanish lessons on TV He had probably never thought\\nabout the difference between hard work and manual labour, either. He\\nwas probably too busy to think about such things - busy with work,\\nand busy bringing home a daughter who had run away to Fukushima.\\n\"So, about that dinner of ours,\" said Nagasawa. \"Would this Saturday\\nbe OK for you?\" \"Fine,\" I said. Nagasawa picked a fancy French restaurant in a quiet backstreet of\\nAzabu. He gave his name at the door and the two of us were shown to\\na secluded private room. Some 15 prints hung on the walls of the\\nsmall chamber. While we waited for Hatsumi to arrive, Nagasawa and\\nI sipped a delicious wine and chatted about the novels of Joseph\\nConrad. He wore an expensive-looking grey suit. I had on an ordinary\\nblue blazer. Hatsumi arrived 15 minutes later. She was carefully made up and\\nwore gold earrings, a beautiful deep blue dress, and tasteful red court\\nshoes. When I complimented her on the colour of her dress, she told\\nme it was called midnight blue. \"What an elegant restaurant!\" she said. \"My old man always eats here when he comes to Tokyo,\" said\\nNagasawa. \"I came here with him once. I\\'m not crazy about these\\nsnooty places.\" \"It doesn\\'t hurt to eat in a place like this once in a while,\" said\\nHatsumi. Turning to me, she asked, \"Don\\'t you agree?\" \"I guess so. As\\nlong as I\\'m not paying.\" \"My old man usually brings his mistress here,\" said Nagasawa. \"He\\'s\\ngot one in Tokyo, you know.\" \"Really?\" asked Hatsumi. I took a sip of\\nwine, as if I had heard nothing. Eventually a waiter came and took our orders. After choosing hors\\nd\\'oeuvres and soup, Nagasawa ordered duck, and Hatsumi and I\\nordered sea bass. The food arrived at a leisurely pace, which allowed\\nus to enjoy the wine and conversation. Nagasawa spoke first of the\\nForeign Ministry exam. Most of the examinees were scum who might\\njust as well be thrown into a bottomless pit, he said, though he\\nsupposed there were a few decent ones in the bunch. I asked if he\\nthought the ratio of good ones to scum was higher or lower than in\\nsociety at large. \"It\\'s the same,\" he said. \"Of course.\" It was the same everywhere, he\\nadded: an immutable law. Nagasawa ordered a second bottle of wine and a double Scotch for\\nhimself. Hatsumi then began talking about a girl she wanted to fix me up with.\\nThis was a perpetual topic between us. She was always telling me\\nabout some \"cute girl in my club\", and I was always running away.\\n\"She\\'s \\nreally\\n nice, though, and \\nreally\\n cute. I\\'ll bring her along next\\ntime. You ought to talk to her. I\\'m sure you\\'ll like her.\" \"It\\'s a waste of time, Hatsumi,\" I said. \"I\\'m too poor to go out with\\ngirls from your university. I can\\'t talk to them.\" \"Don\\'t be silly,\" she said. \"This girl is simple and natural and\\nunaffected.\" \"Come on, Watanabe,\" said Nagasawa. \"Just meet her. You don’t have\\nto screw her.\" \"I should \\nsay not!\"\\n said Hatsumi. \"She\\'s a virgin.\" \"Like you used to be,\" said Nagasawa. \"Exactly,\" said Hatsumi with a bright smile. \"Like I used to be. But\\nreally,\" she said to me, \"don\\'t give me that stuff about being \"too\\npoor\\'. It\\'s got nothing to do with it. Sure, there are a few super-stuck-\\nup girls in every year, but the rest of us are just ordinary. We all eat\\nlunch in the school cafeteria for ? 250 -\" \"Now wait just a minute, Hatsumi,\" I said, interrupting her. \"In my school the cafeteria has three lunches: A, B, and C. The A Lunch is\\n? 120, the B Lunch is ? 100, and the C Lunch is ? 80. Everybody gives\\nme dirty looks when I eat the A Lunch, and anyone who can\\'t afford\\nthe C Lunch eats ramen noodles for ? 60. That\\'s the kind of place I go\\nto. You still think I can talk to girls from yours?\" Hatsumi could barely stop laughing. \"That\\'s so \\ncheap!\"\\n she said.\\n\"Maybe I should go there for lunch! But really. Torn, you\\'re such a\\nnice guy. I\\'m sure you’d get along with this girl. She might even like\\nthe ? 120 lunch.\" \"No way,\" I said with a laugh. \\n\"Nobody\\n eats that stuff because they\\nlike it; they eat it because they can\\'t afford anything else.\" \"Anyway, don\\'t judge a book by its cover. It\\'s true we go to this hoity-\\ntoity establishment, but lots of us there are serious people who think\\nserious thoughts about life. Not \\neverybody\\n is looking for a boyfriend\\nwith a sports car.\" \"I know that much,\" I said. \"Watanabe\\'s got a girl. He\\'s in love,\" said Nagasawa. \"But he won’t\\nsay a word about her. He\\'s as tight-lipped as they come. A riddle\\nwrapped in an enigma.\" \"Really?\" Hatsumi asked me. \"Really,\" I said. \"But there\\'s no riddle involved here. It\\'s just that it\\'s\\ncomplicated, and hard to talk about.\" \"An illicit love? Ooh! You can talk to \\nme!\"\\n I took a sip of wine to\\navoid answering. \"See what I mean?\" said Nagasawa, at work on his third whisky.\\n\"Tight-lipped. When this guy decides he\\'s not going to talk about\\nsomething, nobody can drag it out of him.\" \"What a shame,\" said\\nHatsumi as she cut a small slice of terrine and brought it to her lips.\\n\"If you\\'d got on with her, we could have double-dated.\" \"Yeah, we could’ve got drunk and done a little swapping,\" said\\nNagasawa. \"Enough of that kind of talk,\" said Hatsumi. \"What do you mean \"that kind of talk\\'? Watanabe\\'s got his eye on\\nyou,\" said Nagasawa. \"That has nothing to do with what I\\'m talking about,\" Hatsumi\\nmurmured. \"He\\'s not that kind of person. He\\'s sincere and caring. I can\\ntell. That\\'s why I\\'ve been trying to fix him up.\" \"Oh, sure, he\\'s sincere. Like the time we swapped women once, way\\nback when. Remember, Watanabe?\" Nagasawa said this with a blase\\nlook on his face, then slugged back the rest of his whisky and ordered\\nanother. Hatsumi set her knife and fork down and dabbed at her mouth with\\nher napkin. Then, looking at me, she asked, \"Tom, did you really do\\nthat?\" I didn\\'t know how to answer her, and so I said nothing. \"Tell her,\" said Nagasawa. \"What the hell.\" The mood was turning\\nsour. Nagasawa could get nasty when he was drunk, but tonight his\\nnastiness was aimed at Hatsumi, not at me. Knowing that made it all\\nthe more difficult for me to go on sitting there. \"I’d like to hear about that,\" said Hatsumi. \"It sounds \\nvery\\n interesting!\"\\n\"We were drunk,\" I said. \"That’s all right. Torn. I’m not blaming you. I just want you to tell me\\nwhat happened.\" \"The two of us were drinking in a bar in Shibuya, and we got friendly\\nwith this pair of girls. They went to some college, and they were\\npretty plastered, too. So, anyway, we, uh, went to a hotel and slept\\nwith them. Our rooms were right next door to each other, hi the\\nmiddle of the night, Nagasawa knocked on my door and said we\\nshould change girls, so I went to his room and he came to mine.\" \"Didn\\'t the girls mind?\" \"No, they were drunk too.\" \"Anyway, I had a good reason for doing it,\" said Nagasawa. \"A good reason?\" \"Well, the girls were too different. One was really goodlooking, but the other one was a dog. It seemed unfair to me. I got the pretty girl,\\nbut Watanabe got stuck with the other one. That\\'s why we swapped.\\nRight, Watanabe?\" \"Yeah, I s\\'pose so,\" I said. But in fact, I had liked the not-pretty one.\\nShe was fun to talk to and a nice person. After we had sex, we were\\nenjoying talking to each other in bed when Nagasawa showed up and\\nsuggested we change partners. I asked the girl if she minded, and she\\nsaid it was OK with her if that\\'s what we wanted. She probably\\nthought I wanted to do it with the pretty one. \"Was it fun?\" Hatsumi asked me. \"Swapping, you mean?\" \"The whole thing.\" \"Not especially. It\\'s just something you do. Sleeping with girls that\\nway is not all that much fun.\" \"So why do you do it?\" \"Because of me,\" said Nagasawa. \"I\\'m asking Toru,\" Hatsumi shot back at Nagasawa. \"Why do you do\\nsomething like that?\" \"Because sometimes I have this tremendous desire to sleep with a\\ngirl.\" \"If you\\'re in love with someone, can\\'t you manage one way or another\\nwith her?\" Hatsumi asked after a few moments\\' thought. \"It\\'s complicated.\" Hatsumi sighed. At that point the door opened and the food was carried in. Nagasawa\\nwas presented with his roast duck, and Hatsumi and I received our sea\\nbass. The waiters heaped freshcooked vegetables on our plates and\\ndribbled sauce on them before withdrawing and leaving the three of us\\nalone again. Nagasawa cut a slice of duck and ate it with gusto,\\nfollowed by more whisky. I took a forkful of spinach. Hatsumi didn’t\\ntouch her food. \"You know, Tom,\" she said. \"I have no idea what makes \\nyour\\nsituation so \"complicated\\', but I do think that the kind of thing you just\\ntold me about is not right for you. You\\'re not that kind of person.\\nWhat do you think?\" She placed her hands on the table and looked me\\nin the eye. \"Well,\" I said, \"I\\'ve felt that way myself sometimes.\" \"So why don\\'t you stop?\" \"Because sometimes I have a need for human warmth,\" I answered\\nhonestly. \"Sometimes, if I can\\'t feel something like the warmth of a\\nwoman\\'s skin, I get so lonely I can\\'t stand it.\" \"Here, let me summarize what I think it\\'s all about,\" interjected\\nNagasawa. \"Watanabe\\'s got this girl he likes, but for certain\\ncomplicated reasons, they can\\'t do it. So he tells himself \"Sex is just\\nsex\\', and he takes care of his need with somebody else. What\\'s wrong\\nwith that? It makes perfect sense. He can\\'t just stay locked in his room\\ntossing off all the time, can he?\" \"But if you really love her, Tom, shouldn’t it be possible for you to\\ncontrol yourself ?\" \"Maybe so,\" I said, bringing a piece of sea bass in cream sauce to my\\nmouth. \"You just don\\'t understand a man\\'s sexual needs,\" said Nagasawa to\\nHatsumi. \"Look at me, for example. I\\'ve been with you for three years,\\nand I\\'ve slept with plenty of women in that time. But I don\\'t remember\\na thing about them. I don\\'t know their names, I don\\'t remember their\\nfaces. I slept with each of them exactly once. Meet \\'em, do it, so long.\\nThat\\'s it. What\\'s wrong with that?\" \"What I can\\'t stand is that arrogance of yours,\" said Hatsumi in a soft\\nvoice. \"Whether you sleep with other women or not is beside the\\npoint. I\\'ve never really been angry with you for sleeping around, have\\nI?\" \"You can\\'t even call what I do sleeping around. It\\'s just a game. Nobody gets hurt,\" said Nagasawa. \"I get hurt,\" said Hatsumi. \"Why am I not enough for you?\" Nagasawa kept silent for a moment and swirled the whisky in his\\nglass. \"It\\'s not that you\\'re not enough for me. That\\'s another phase,\\nanother question. It\\'s just a hunger I have inside me. If I\\'ve hurt you.\\nI\\'m sorry. But it\\'s not a question of whether or not you\\'re enough for\\nme. I can only live with that hunger. That\\'s the kind of man I am.\\nThat\\'s what makes me me. There\\'s nothing I can do about it, don\\'t you\\nsee?\" At last Hatsumi picked up her silverware and started eating her fish.\\n\"At least you shouldn’t drag Torn into your \"games\\'.\" \"We\\'re a lot alike, though, Watanabe and me,\" said Nagasawa.\\n\"Neither of us is interested, essentially, in anything but ourselves. OK.\\nso I\\'m arrogant and he\\'s not, but neither of us is able to feel any\\ninterest in anything other than what we ourselves think or feel or do.\\nThat\\'s why we can think about things in a way that\\'s totally divorced\\nfrom anybody else. That\\'s what I like about him. The only difference\\nis that he hasn\\'t realized this about himself, and so he hesitates and\\nfeels hurt.\" \"What human being \\ndoesn\\'t\\n hesitate and feel hurt?\" Hatsumi\\ndemanded. \"Are you trying to say that \\nyou\\n have never felt those\\nthings?\" \"Of course I have, but I\\'ve disciplined myself to where I can minimize\\nthem. Even a rat will choose the least painful route if you shock him\\nenough.\" \"But rats don\\'t fall in love.\" \"\"Rats don\\'t fall in love\\'.\" Nagasawa looked at me. \"That\\'s great. We\\nshould have background music for this - a full orchestra with two\\nharps and -\" \"Don\\'t make fun of me. I\\'m serious.\" -We\\'re eating,\" said Nagasawa. \"And Watanabe\\'s here. It .night be\\nmore civil for us to confine \\'serious\\' talk to another occasion.\" \"I can leave,\" I said. \"No,\" said Hatsumi. \"Please stay. It\\'s better with you here.\" \"At least have dessert,\" said Nagasawa. \"I don’t mind, really.\" The three of us went on eating in silence for a time. I finished my fish.\\nHatsumi left half of hers. Nagasawa had polished off his duck long\\nbefore and was now concentrating on his whisky. \"That was excellent sea bass,\" I offered, but no one took me up on it. I\\nmight as well have thrown a rock down a deep well. The waiters took away our plates and brought lemon sherbet and\\nespresso. Nagasawa barely touched his dessert and coffee, moving\\ndirectly to a cigarette. Hatsumi ignored her sherbet. \"Oh boy,\" I\\nthought to myself as I finished my sherbet and coffee. Hatsumi stared\\nat her hands on the table. Like everything she wore, her hands looked\\nchic and elegant and expensive. I thought about Naoko and Reiko.\\nWhat would they be doing now? I wondered. Naoko could be lying on\\nthe sofa reading a book, and Reiko might be playing \"Norwegian\\nWood\" on her guitar. I felt an intense desire to go back to that little\\nroom of theirs. What the hell was I doing in this place? \"Where Watanabe and I are alike is, we don\\'t give a shit if nobody\\nunderstands us,\" Nagasawa said. \"That\\'s what makes us different from\\neverybody else. They\\'re all worried about whether the people around\\nthem understand them. But not me, and not Watanabe. We just don\\'t\\ngive a shit. Self and others are separate.\" \"Is this true?\" Hatsumi asked me. \"No,\" I said. \"I\\'m not that strong. I don\\'t feel it\\'s OK if nobody\\nunderstands me. I\\'ve got people I want to understand and be\\nunderstood by. But aside from those few, well, I feel it\\'s kind of\\nhopeless. I don\\'t agree with Nagasawa. I do care if people understand\\nme.\" \"That\\'s practically the same thing as what I\\'m saying,\" said Nagasawa,\\npicking up his coffee spoon. \"It is the same! It\\'s the difference between a late breakfast or an early lunch. Same time, same food,\\ndifferent name.\" Now Hatsumi spoke to Nagasawa. \"Don\\'t you care whether I\\nunderstand you or not?\" \"You don’t get it, do you? Person A understands Person B because the\\ntime is\\n right for that to happen, not because Person B \\nwants to be\\nunderstood by\\n Person A.\" \"So is it a mistake for me to feel that I want to be understood by\\nsomeone - by \\nyou,\\n for example?\" \"No, it’s not a mistake,\" answered Nagasawa. \"Most people would call\\nthat love, if you think you want to understand me. My system for\\nliving is way different from other people\\'s systems for living.\" \"So what you\\'re saying is you\\'re not in love with me, is that it?\" \"Well, my system and your -\" \"To hell with your fucking system!\" Hatsumi shouted. That\\nwas the first and last time I ever heard her shout. Nagasawa pushed the button by the table, and the waiter came in with the bill. Nagasawa handed him a credit card. \"Sony about this, Watanabe,\" said Nagasawa. \"I\\'m going to see Hatsumi home. You go back to the donn alone, OK?\" \"You don\\'t have to apologize to me. Great meal,\" I said, but no one said anything in response. The waiter brought the card, and Nagasawa signed with a ballpoint\\npen after checking the amount. Then the three of us stood and went\\noutside. Nagasawa started to step into the street to hail a taxi, but\\nHatsumi stopped him. \"Thanks, but I don\\'t want to spend any more time with you today. You\\ndon’t have to see me home. Thank you for dinner.\" ..Whatever,\" said Nagasawa. \"I want Tom to see me home.\" \"Whatever,\" said Nagasawa. \"But Watanabe\\'s practically the same as\\nme. He may be a nice guy, but deep down in his heart he\\'s incapable of loving anybody. There\\'s always some part of him somewhere that\\'s\\nwide awake and detached. He just has that hunger that won\\'t go away.\\nBelieve me, I know what I\\'m talking about.\" I flagged down a taxi and let Hatsumi in first. \"Anyway,\" I said to\\nNagasawa, \"I\\'ll make sure she gets home.\" \"Sorry to put you through this,\" said Nagasawa, but I could see that he\\nwas already thinking about something else. Once inside the cab, I asked Hatsumi, \"Where do you want to go?\\nBack to Ebisu?\" Her flat was in Ebisu. She shook her head. \"OK. How about a drink somewhere?\" \"Yes,\" she said with a nod. \"Shibuya,\" I told the driver. Folding her arms and closing her eyes, Hatsumi sank back into the\\ncomer of the seat. Her small gold earrings caught the light as the taxi\\nswayed. Her midnight-blue dress seemed to have been made to match\\nthe darkness of the interior. Every now and then her lightly made-up,\\nbeautifully formed lips would quiver slightly as though she had caught\\nherself on the verge of talking to herself. Watching her, I could see\\nwhy Nagasawa had chosen her as his special companion. There were\\nany number of women more beautiful than Hatsumi, and Nagasawa\\ncould have made any of them his. But Hatsumi had some quality that\\ncould send a tremor through your heart. It was nothing forceful. The\\npower she exerted was a subtle thing, but it called forth deep\\nresonances. I watched her all the way to Shibuya, and wondered,\\nwithout ever finding an answer, what this emotional reverberation\\ncould be that I was feeling. It finally hit me some dozen or so years later. I had gone to Santa Fe\\nto interview a painter and was sitting in a local pizza parlour, drinking\\nbeer and eating pizza and watching a miraculously beautiful sunset.\\nEverything was soaked in brilliant red - my hand, the plate, the table. the world - as if some special kind of fruit juice had splashed down on\\neverything. In the midst of this overwhelming sunset, the image of\\nHatsumi flashed into my mind, and in that moment I understood what\\nthat tremor of the heart had been. It was a kind of childhood longing\\nthat had always remained - and would for ever remain - unfulfilled. I\\nhad forgotten the existence of such innocent, almost burnt-in longing:\\nforgotten for years that such feelings had ever existed inside me. What\\nHatsumi had stirred in me was a part of my very self that had long lain\\ndormant. And when the realization struck me, it aroused such sorrow I\\nalmost burst into tears. She had been an absolutely special woman.\\nSomeone should have done something - anything - to save her. But neither Nagasawa nor I could have managed that. As so many of\\nthose I knew had done, Hatsumi reached a certain stage in life and\\ndecided - almost on the spur of the moment - to end it. Two years after\\nNagasawa left for Germany, she married, and two years after that she\\nslashed her wrists with a razor blade. It was Nagasawa, of course, who told me what had\\nhappened. His letter from Bonn said this: \"Hatsumi\\'s death has\\nextinguished something. This is unbearably sad and painful, even to\\nme.\" I ripped his letter to shreds and threw it away. I never wrote to\\nhim again. Hatsumi and I went to a small bar and downed several drinks. Neither\\nof us said much. Like a bored, old married couple, we sat opposite\\neach other, drinking in silence and munching peanuts. When the place\\nbegan to fill up, we went for a walk. Hatsumi said she would pay the\\nbill, but I insisted on paying because the drinks had been my idea. There was a deep chill in the night air. Hatsumi wrapped herself in her\\npale grey cardigan and walked by my side in silence. I had no\\ndestination in mind as we ambled through the nighttime streets, my\\nhands shoved deep into my pockets. This was just like walking with\\nNaoko, it occurred to me. \"Do you know somewhere we could play pool around here?\" Hatsumi\\nasked me without warning. \"Pool? You play?\" \"Yeah, I\\'m pretty good. How about you?\" \"I play a little. Not that I\\'m very good at it.\" \"OK. then. Let\\'s go.\" We found a pool hall nearby and went in. It was a small place at the\\nfar end of an alley. The two of us - Hatsumi in her chic dress and I in\\nmy blue blazer and regimental tie - clashed with the scruffy pool hall,\\nbut this didn\\'t seem to concern Hatsumi at all as she chose and chalked\\nher cue. She pulled a hairslide from her bag and clipped her hair aside\\nat one temple to keep it from interfering with her game. We played two games. Hatsumi was as good as she had claimed to be,\\nwhile my own game was hampered by the thick bandage I still wore\\non my cut hand. She crashed me. \"You’re great,\" I said in admiration. \"You mean appearances can be deceiving?\" she asked as she sized up\\na shot, smiling. \"Where did you learn to play like that?\" \"My grandfather - my father\\'s father - was an old playboy. He had a\\ntable in his house. I used to play pool with my brother just for fun, and\\nwhen I got a little bigger my grandfather taught me the right moves.\\nHe was a wonderful guy - stylish, handsome. He\\'s dead now, though.\\nHe always used to boast how he once met Deanna Durbin in New\\nYork.\" She got three in a row, then missed on the fourth try. I managed to\\nsqueeze out a point, then missed an easy shot. \"It\\'s the bandage,\" said Hatsumi to comfort me. \"No, it\\'s because I haven\\'t played for so long,\" I said. \"Two years and\\nfive months.\" \"How can you be so sure of the time?\" \"My friend died the night after our last game together,\" I said. \"So you stopped playing?\" \"No, not really,\" I said after giving it some thought. \"I just never had\\nthe opportunity to play after that. That\\'s all.\" \"How did your friend\\ndie?\" \"Traffic accident.\" She made several more shots, aiming with deadly seriousness and\\nadjusting the strength of each shot with precision. Watching her in\\naction - her carefully set hair swept back out of her eyes, golden\\nearrings sparkling, court shoes set firmly on the floor, lovely, slender\\nfingers pressing the green baize as she took her shot - I felt as if her\\nside of the scruffy pool hall had been transformed into part of some\\nelegant social event. I had never spent time with her alone before, and\\nthis was a marvellous experience for me, as though I had been drawn\\nup to a higher plane of life. At the end of the third game - in which, of\\ncourse, she crushed me again -my cut began to throb, and so we\\nstopped playing. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she said with what seemed like genuine concern. \"I should\\nnever have suggested this.\" \"That\\'s OK,\" I said. \"It\\'s not a bad cut, I enjoyed playing. Really.\" As we were leaving the pool hall, the skinny woman owner said to\\nHatsumi, \"You\\'ve a good eye, sister.\" Hatsumi gave her a sweet smile\\nand thanked her as she paid the bill. \"Does it hurt?\" she asked when we were outside. \"Not much,\" I said. \"Do you think it opened?\" \"No, it’s probably OK.\" \"I know! You should come to my place. I\\'ll change your bandage for\\nyou. I\\'ve got disinfectant and everything. Come on. I\\'m right over\\nthere.\" I told her it wasn\\'t worth worrying about, that I’d be OK. but she\\ninsisted we had to check to see if the cut had opened or not. \"Or is it that you don\\'t like being with me? You want to go back to\\nyour room as soon as possible, is that it?\" she said with a playful\\nsmile. \"No way,\" I said. \"All right, then. Don’t stand on ceremony. It\\'s a short walk.\" Hatsumi\\'s flat was a 15-minute walk from Shibuya towards Ebisu. By\\nno means a glamorous building, it was more than decent, with a nice\\nlittle lobby and a lift. Hatsumi sat me at the kitchen table and went to\\nthe bedroom to change. She came out wearing a Princeton hooded\\nsweatshirt and cotton trousers - and no more gold earrings. Setting a\\nfirst-aid box on the table, she undid my bandage, checked to see that\\nthe wound was still sealed, put a little disinfectant on the area and tied\\na new bandage over the cut. She did all this like an expert. \"How come\\nyou\\'re so good at so many things?\" I asked. \"I used to do volunteer work at a hospital. Kind of like playing nurse.\\nThat\\'s how I learned.\" When Hatsumi had finished with the bandage, she went and fetched\\ntwo cans of beer from the fridge. She drank half of hers, and I drank\\nmine plus the half she left. Then she showed me pictures of the other\\ngirls in her club. She was right: some of them were cute. \"Any time you decide you want a girlfriend, come to me,\" she said.\\n\"I\\'ll fix you up straight away.\" \"Yes, Miss.\" \\'All right, Tom, tell me the truth. You think I\\'m an old matchmaker,\\ndon’t you?\" \"To some extent,\" I said, telling her the truth, but with a smile.\\nHatsumi smiled, too. She looked good when she smiled. \"Tell me something else, Tom,\" she said. \"What do you think about\\nNagasawa and me?\" \"What do you mean what do I think? About what?\" \"About what I ought to do. From now on.\" \"It doesn\\'t matter what I think,\" I said, taking a slug of cold beer. \"That\\'s all right. Tell me exactly what you think.\" \"Well, if I were you, I\\'d leave him. I\\'d find someone with a more\\nnormal way of looking at things and live happily ever after. There\\'s no\\nway in hell you can be happy with him. The way he lives, it never\\ncrosses his mind to try to make himself happy or to make others\\nhappy. Staying with him will only wreck your nervous system. To me,\\nit\\'s already a miracle that you\\'ve been with him three years. Of course.\\nI\\'m very fond of him in my own way. He\\'s fun, and he has lots of great\\nqualities. He has strengths and abilities that I could never hope to match. But in\\nthe end, his ideas about things and the way he lives his life are not\\nnormal. Sometimes, when I\\'m talking to him, I feel as if I\\'m going\\naround and around in circles. The same process that takes him higher\\nand higher leaves me going around in circles. It makes me feel so\\nempty! Finally, our very systems are totally different. Do you see\\nwhat I\\'m saying?\" \"I do,\" Hatsumi said as she brought me another beer from the fridge.\\n\"Plus, after he gets into the Foreign Ministry and does a year of\\ntraining, he\\'ll be going abroad. What are \\nyou\\n going to do all that time?\\nWait for him? He has no intention of marrying anyone.\" \"I know that, too.\" \"So I\\'ve got nothing else to say.\" \"I see,\" said Hatsumi. I slowly filled my glass with beer. \"You know, when we were playing pool before, something popped\\ninto my mind,\" I said. \"I was an only child, but all the time I was\\ngrowing up I never once felt deprived or wished I had brothers or\\nsisters. I was happy being alone. But all of a sudden, playing pool with\\nyou, I had this feeling that I wished I had had an elder sister like you -\\nreally chic aid a knockout in a midnight-blue dress and gold earrings\\nand great with a pool cue.\" Hatsumi flashed me a happy smile. \"That\\'s got to be the nicest thing anybody\\'s said to me in the past year,\" she said. \"Really.\" \"All I want for you,\" I said, blushing, \"is for you to be happy. It\\'s\\ncrazy, though. You seem like someone who could be happy with just\\nabout anybody, so how did you end up with Nagasawa of all people?\" \"Things like that just happen. There\\'s probably not much you can do\\nabout them. It\\'s certainly true in my case. Of course, Nagasawa would\\nsay it\\'s my responsibility, not his.\\' \"I\\'m sure he would.\" \"But anyway, Tom, I\\'m not the smartest girl in the world. If anything.\\nI\\'m sort of on the stupid side, and old-fashioned. I couldn\\'t care less\\nabout \"systems\\' and \"responsibility\\'. All I want is to get married and\\nhave a man I love hold me in his arms every night and make babies.\\nThat\\'s plenty for me. It\\'s all I want out of life.\" \"And what Nagasawa wants out of life has nothing to do with that.\"\\n\"People change, though, don\\'t you think?\" Hatsumi asked. \"You mean,\\nlike, they go out into society and get a kick up the arse and grow up?\"\\n\"Yeah. And if he\\'s away from me for a long time, his feelings for me\\ncould change, don\\'t you think?\" \"Maybe, if he were an ordinary guy,\" I said. \"But he\\'s different. He\\'s\\nincredibly strong-willed - stronger than you or I can imagine. And he\\nonly makes himself stronger with every day that goes by. If something\\nsmashes into him, he just works to make himself stronger. He’d eat\\nslugs before he\\'d back down to anyone. What do you expect to get\\nfrom a man like that?\" \"But there\\'s nothing \\nI can\\n do but wait for him,\" said Hatsumi with her\\nchin in her hand. \"You love him that much?\" \"I do,\" she answered without a moment\\'s hesitation. \"Oh boy,\" I said with a sigh, drinking down the last of my beer. \"It\\nmust be a wonderful thing to be so sure that you love somebody.\" \"I\\'m a stupid, old-fashioned girl,\" she said. \"Have another beer?\" \"No, thanks, I must get going. Thanks for the bandage and beer.\" As I was standing in the hallway putting on my shoes, the telephone\\nrang. Hatsumi looked at me, looked at the phone,\\nand looked at me again. \"Good night,\" I said, stepping outside. As I shut the door, I caught a\\nglimpse of Hatsumi picking up the receiver. It was the last time I ever\\nsaw her. It was 11.30 by the time I got back to the dorm. I went straight to\\nNagasawa\\'s room and knocked on his door. After the tenth knock it\\noccurred to me that this was Saturday night. Nagasawa always got\\novernight permission on Saturday nights, supposedly to stay at his\\nrelatives\\' house. I went back to my room, took off my tie, put my jacket and trousers\\non a hanger, changed into my pyjamas, and brushed my teeth. Oh no, I\\nthought, tomorrow is Sunday again! Sundays seemed to be rolling\\naround every four days. Another two Sundays and I would be 20 years\\nold. I stretched out in bed and stared at my calendar as dark feelings\\nwashed over me. I sat at my desk to write my Sunday morning letter to Naoko, drinking\\ncoffee from a big cup and listening to old Miles Davis albums. A fine\\nrain was falling outside, while my room had the chill of an aquarium.\\nThe smell of mothballs lingered in the thick jumper I had just taken\\nout of a storage box. High up on the window-pane clung a huge, fat\\nfly, unmoving. With no wind to stir it, the Rising Sun standard hung\\nlimp against the flagpole like the toga of a Roman senator. A skinny,\\ntimid-looking brown dog that had wandered into the quadrangle was\\nsniffing every blossom in the flowerbed. I couldn\\'t begin to imagine\\nwhy any dog would have to go around sniffing flowers on a rainy day.\\nMy letter was a long one, and whenever my cut right palm began to\\nhurt from holding the pen. I would let my eyes wander out to the rainy quadrangle. I began l\\nly\\n telling Naoko how I had given my right hand a nasty cut\\nwhile working in the record shop, then went on to say that Nagasawa,\\nHatsumi and I had had a sort of celebration the night before for\\nNagasawa\\'s having passed his Foreign Ministry exam. I described the\\nrestaurant and the food. The meal was great, I said, but the atmosphere\\ngot uncomfortable halfway through. I wondered if I should write about Kizuki in connection with having\\nplayed pool with Hatsumi and decided to go ahead. I felt it was\\nsomething I ought to write about. I still remember the last shot Kizuki took that day - the day he died. It\\nwas a difficult cushion shot that I never expected him to get. Luck\\nseemed to be with him, though: the shot was absolutely perfect, and\\nthe white and red balls hardly made a sound as they brushed each\\nother on the green baize for the last score of the game. It was such a\\nbeautiful shot, I still have a vivid image of it to this day. For nearly\\ntwo-and-a-half years after that, I never touched a cue. The night I played pool with Hatsumi, though, the thought of Kizuki\\nnever crossed my mind until the first game ended, and this came as a\\nreal shock to me. I had always assumed that I’d be reminded of Kizuki\\nwhenever I played pool. But not until the first game was over and I\\nbought a Pepsi from a vending machine and started drinking it did I\\neven think of him. It was the pool hall we used to play in. and we had\\noften bet drinks on the outcome of our games. I felt guilty that I hadn\\'t thought of Kizuki straight away, as if I had\\nsomehow abandoned him. Back in my room, though, I came to think\\nof it like this: two and-a-half years have gone by since it happened,\\nand Kizuki is still 17 years old. Not that this means my memory of\\nhim has faded. The things that his death gave rise to are still there,\\nbright and clear, inside me, some of them even clearer than when they\\nwere new. What I want to say is this: I\\'m going to turn 20 soon. Part of what Kizuki and I shared when we were 16 and 17 has already\\nvanished, and no amount of crying is going to bring that back. I can\\'t\\nexplain it any better than this, but I think that you can probably understand what I felt and what I am trying to say. In fact, you are probably\\nthe only one in the world who can understand. I think of you now more than ever. It\\'s raining today. Rainy Sundays\\nare hard for me. When it rains I can\\'t do laundry, which means I can\\'t\\ndo ironing. I can\\'t go walking, and I can\\'t lie on the roof. About all I\\ncan do is put the record player on auto repeat and listen to \\nKind of\\nBlue\\n over and over while I watch the rain falling in the quadrangle. As\\nI wrote to you earlier, I don\\'t wind my spring on Sundays. That\\'s why\\nthis letter is so damn long. I\\'m stopping now. I\\'m going to the dining\\nhall for lunch. Goodbye. \\n \\n \\n \\n There was no sign of Midori at the next day\\'s lecture, either. What had\\nhappened to her? Ten days had gone by since we last talked on the\\nphone. I thought about calling her, but decided against it. She had said\\nthat \\nshe\\n would call \\nme. That Thursday I saw Nagasawa in the dining hall. He sat down next to\\nme with a tray full of food and apologized for having made our\\n\"party\" so unpleasant. \"Never mind,\" I said. \"I should be thanking you for a great dinner. I\\nhave to admit, though, it was a funny way to celebrate your first job.\"\\n\"You can say that again.\" A few minutes went by as we ate in silence. \"I made up with\\nHatsumi,\" he said. \"I\\'m not surprised.\" \"I was kind of tough on you, too, as I recall it.\" \"What\\'s with all the apologizing?\" I asked. \"Are you ill?\" \"I may be,\" he said with a few little nods. \"Hatsumi tells me you told\\nher to leave me.\" \"It only makes sense,\" I said. \"Yeah, I s\\'pose so,\" said Nagasawa. \"She\\'s a great girl,\" I said, slurping my miso soup. \"I know,\" he said with a sigh. \"A little too great for me.\" I was sleeping the sleep of death when the buzzer rang to let me know\\nI had a call. It brought me back from the absolute core of sleep in total confusion. I felt as if I had been sleeping with my head soaked in\\nwater until my brain swelled up. The clock said 6.15 but I had no idea\\nif that meant a.m. or p.m., and I couldn\\'t remember what day it was. I\\nlooked out of the window and realized there was no flag on the pole. It\\nwas probably p.m. So, raising that flag served some purpose after all.\\n\"Hey, Watanabe, are you free now?\" Midori asked. \"I don\\'t know, what day is it?\" \"Friday.\" \"Morning or evening?\" \"Evening, of course! You\\'re so weird! Let\\'s see, it’s, uh, 6.18 p.m.\" So it was p.m. after all! That\\'s right, I had been stretched out on my\\nbed reading a book when I dozed off. Friday. My head started\\nworking. I didn\\'t have to go to the record shop on Friday nights.\\n\"Yeah, I\\'m free. Where are you?\" \"Ueno Station. Why don\\'t you meet me in Shinjuku? I\\'ll leave now.\" We set a time and place and hung up. When I got to DUG, Midori was sitting at the far end of the counter\\nwith a drink. She wore a man\\'s wrinkled, white balmacaan coat, a thin\\nyellow jumper, blue jeans, and two bracelets on one wrist. \"What\\'re you drinking?\" I asked. \"Tom Collins.\" I ordered a whisky and soda, then realized there was a big suitcase by\\nMidori\\'s feet. I went away,\" she said. \"Just got back.\" \"Where\\'d you go?\" \"South to Nara and north to Aomori.\" \"On the same trip?!\" \"Don\\'t be stupid. I may be strange, but I can\\'t go north and south at the\\nsame time. I went to Nara with my boyfriend, and then took off to\\nAomori alone.\" I sipped my whisky and soda, then struck a match to light the\\nMarlboro that Midori held between her lips. \"You must have had a\\nterrible time, what with the funeral and everything.\" \"Nah, a funeral\\'s a piece of cake. We\\'ve had plenty of practice. You\\nput on a black kimono and sit there like a lady and everybody else\\ntakes care of business - an uncle, a neighbour, like that. They bring the\\nsake, order the sushi, say comforting things, cry, carry on. divide up\\nthe keepsakes. It\\'s a breeze. A picnic. Compared to nursing someone\\nday after day, it\\'s an absolute picnic. We were drained, my sister and\\nme. We couldn’t even cry. We didn\\'t have any tears left. Really.\\nExcept, when you do that, they start whispering about you: \"Those\\ngirls are as cold as ice.’ So then, we’re \\nnever\\n going to cry, that’s just\\nhow the two of us are. I know we could have faked it, but we would\\nnever do anything like that. The bastards! The more they wanted to\\nsee us cry, the more determined we were not to give them the\\nsatisfaction. My sister and I are totally different types, but when it\\ncomes to something like that, we’re in absolute sync.\" Midori\\'s bracelets jangled on her arm as she waved to the waiter and\\nordered another Tom Collins and a small bowl of pistachios. \"So then, after the funeral ended and everybody went home, the two of\\nus drank sake till the sun went down. Polished off one of those huge\\nhalf-gallon bottles, and half of another one, aid the whole time we\\nwere dumping on everybody - this one\\'s an idiot, that one\\'s a shithead, one guy looks like a mangy\\ndog, another one\\'s a pig, so-and-so\\'s a hypocrite, that one\\'s a crook.\\nYou have no idea how great it felt!\" \"I can imagine.\" \"We got pissed and went to bed - both of us out cold. We slept for\\nhours, and if the phone rang or something, we just let it go. Dead to\\nthe world. Finally, after we woke up, we ordered sushi and talked\\nabout what to do. We decided to close the shop for a while and enjoy\\nourselves. We\\'d been killing ourselves for months and we deserved a break. My sister just wanted to hang around with her boyfriend for a\\nwhile, and I decided I\\'d take mine on a trip for a couple of days and\\nfuck like crazy.\" Midori clamped her mouth shut and rubbed her ears.\\n\"Oops, sorry.\" \"That\\'s OK,\" I said. \"So you went to Nara.\" \"Yeah, I’ve always liked that place. The temples, the deer park.\" \"And did you fuck like crazy?\" \"No, not at all, not even once,\" she said with a sigh. \"The second we\\nwalked into the hotel room and dumped our bags, my period started. A\\nreal gusher.\" I couldn\\'t help laughing. \"Hey, it’s not funny. I was a week early! I couldn’t stop crying when\\nthat happened. I think all the stress threw me off. My boyfriend got\\nsooo\\n angry! He’s like that: he gets angry straight away. It wasn\\'t \\nmy\\nfault, though. It\\'s not like \\nI wanted\\n to get my period. And, well, mine\\nare kind of on the heavy side anyway. The first day or two, I don\\'t\\nwant to do \\nanything.\\n Make sure you keep away from me then.\" \"I’d like to, but how can I tell?\" I asked. \"OK. I\\'ll wear a hat for a couple of days after my period starts. A red\\none. That should work,\" she said with a laugh \"If you see me on the\\nstreet and I\\'m wearing a red hat, don\\'t talk to me, just run away.\" \"Great. I wish all girls would do that,\" I said. \"So anyway what did\\nyou do in Nara?\" \"What else \\ncould\\n we do? We fed the deer and walked all over the\\nplace. It was just awful! We had a big fight and I haven\\'t seen him\\nsince we got back. I hung around for a couple of days and decided to\\ntake a nice trip all by myself. So I went to Aomori. I stayed with a\\nfriend in Hirosaki for the first two nights, and then I started travelling\\naround - Shimokita, Tappi, places like that. They\\'re nice. I once wrote\\na map brochure for the area. Ever been there?\" \"Never.\" \"So anyway,\" said Midori, sipping her Tom Collins, then wrenching open a pistachio, \"the whole time I was travelling by myself, I was\\nthinking of you. I was thinking how nice it would be if I could have\\nyou with me.\" \"How come?\" \"How come?!\" Midori looked at me with eyes focused on nothingness.\\n\"What do you mean \"How come?\\'?!\" \"Just that. How come you were thinking of me?\" \"Maybe because I like you, that\\'s how come! Why else would I be\\nthinking of you? Who would ever think they wanted to be with\\nsomebody they didn’t like?\" \"But you\\'ve got a boyfriend,\" I said. \"You don\\'t have to think about\\nme.\" I took a slow sip of my whisky and soda. \"Meaning I\\'m not\\nallowed to think about you if I\\'ve got a boyfriend?\" \"No, that\\'s not it, I just -\" \"Now get this straight, Watanabe,\" said Midori, pointing at me. \"I\\'m\\nwarning you. I\\'ve got a whole month\\'s worth of misery crammed\\ninside me and getting ready to blow. So watch what you say to me.\\nAny more of that kind of stuff and I’ll flood this place with tears. Once\\nI get started. I\\'m good for the whole night. Are you ready for that? I\\'m\\nan absolute animal when I start crying, it doesn\\'t matter \\nwhere I am!\\nI\\'m not joking.\" I nodded and kept quiet. I ordered a second whisky and soda and ate a\\nfew pistachios. Somewhere behind the sound of a sloshing shaker and\\nclinking glasses and the scrape of an ice maker, Sarah Vaughan sang\\nan old-fashioned love song. \"Things haven\\'t been right between me and my boyfriend ever since\\nthe tampon incident.\" \"Tampon incident?\" \"Yeah, I was out drinking with him and a few of his friends about a\\nmonth ago and I told them the story of a woman in my neighbourhood\\nwho blew out a tampon when she sneezed. Funny, right?\" \"That is funny,\" I said with a laugh. \"Yeah, all the other guys thought so, too. But he got mad and said I\\nshouldn\\'t be talking about such dirty things. Such a wet blanket!\"\\n\"Wow.\" \"He’s a wonderful guy, but he can be really narrow-minded when it\\ncomes to stuff like that,\" said Midori. \"Like, he gets mad if I wear\\nanything but white underwear. Don’t you think that’s narrow-minded?\"\\n\"Maybe so,\" I said, \"but it’s just a matter of taste.\" It seemed\\nincredible to me that a guy like that would want a girlfriend like\\nMidori, but I kept this thought to myself. \"So, what have you been doing?\" she asked. \"Nothing. Same as ever,\" I said, but then I recalled my attempt to\\nmasturbate while thinking of Midori as I had promised to do. I told her\\nabout it in a low voice that wouldn’t carry to the others around us.\\nMidori\\'s eyes lit up and she snapped her fingers. \"How’d it go? Was it\\ngood?\" \"Nah, I got embarrassed halfway through and stopped.\" \"You mean\\nyou lost your erection ?\" \"Pretty much.\" \"Damn,\" she said, shooting a look of annoyance at me. \"You can\\'t let\\nyourself get embarrassed. Think about something really sexy. It\\'s OK.\\nI\\'m giving you pennission. Hey, I know what! Next time I\\'ll get on the\\nphone with you: \"Oh, oh, that\\'s great... Oh, \\nI feel\\n it... Stop, I\\'m gonna\\ncome ... Oh, don’t do that!\\' I\\'ll say stuff like that to you while you\\'re\\ndoing it.\" \"The dormitory phone is in the lobby by the front door, with people\\ncoming in and out all the time,\" I explained. \"The dorm Head would\\nkill me with his bare hands if he saw me wanking in a place like that.\"\\n\"Oh, too bad.\" \"Never mind,\" I said. \"I\\'ll try again by myself one of these days.\" \"Give it your best shot,\" said Midori. \"I will,\" I said. \"I wonder if it\\'s me,\" she said. \"Maybe I\\'m just not Innately.\" \"That\\'s not it,\" I assured her. \"It\\'s more a question of attitude.\" \"You know,\" she said, \"I have this tremendously sensitive back. The\\nsoft touch of fingers all over ... mmmmm.\" \"I\\'ll keep that in mind.\"\\n\"Hey, why don’t we go now and see a dirty film?\" Midori suggested.\\n\"A really filthy S&M one.\" We went from the bar to an eel shop, and from there to one of\\nShinjuku\\'s most run-down adult cinemas to see a triple bill. It was the\\nonly place we could find in the paper that was showing S&M stuff.\\nInside, the cinema had some kind of indefinable smell. Our timing\\nwas good: the S&M film was just starting as we took our seats. It was\\nthe story of a secretary and her schoolgirl sister being kidnapped by a\\nbunch of men and subjected to sadistic tortures. The men made the\\nolder one to do all kinds of awful things by threatening to rape the\\nsister, but soon the older sister is transformed into a raging masochist,\\nand the younger one gets really turned on from having to watch all the\\ncontortions they put her through. It was such a gloomy, repetitive film,\\nI got bored after a while. \"If I were the younger sister, I wouldn\\'t get worked up so easily,\" said\\nMidori. \"I’d keep watching.\" \"I’m sure you would.\" I said. \"And anyway, don’t you think her nipples are too dark for a schoolgirl\\n- a virgin?\" \"Absolutely.\" Midori\\'s eyes were glued to the screen. I was impressed: anyone\\nwatching a film with such fierce intensity was getting more than her\\nmoney\\'s worth. She kept reporting her thoughts to me: \"Oh my God,\\nwill you look at that!\" or \"Three guys at once! They\\'re going to tear\\nher apart!\" or \"I’d like to try that on somebody, Watanabe.\" I was\\nenjoying Midori a lot more than the film. When the lights went up during the intermission, I realized there were\\nno other women in the place. One young man sitting near us -\\nprobably a student - took one look at Midori and changed his seat to the far side. \"Tell me, Watanabe, do you get hard watching this kind of stuff?\" \"Well, yeah, sometimes,\" I said. \"That\\'s why they \\nmake\\n these films.\" \"So what you\\'re saying is, every time one of those scenes starts, every\\nman in the cinema has his thing standing to attention? Thirty or forty\\nof them sticking up all at once? It\\'s so weird if you stop and think\\nabout it, don\\'t you think?\" \"Yeah, I guess so, now you mention it.\" The second feature was a fairly normal pom flick, which meant it was\\neven more boring than the first. It had lots of oral sex scenes, and\\nevery time they started doing fellatio or cunnilingus or sixty-nine the\\nsoundtrack would fill the cinema with loud sucking or slurping sound\\neffects. Listening to them, I felt strangely moved to think that I was\\nliving out my life on this bizarre planet of ours. \"Who comes up with these sounds, I wonder,\" I said to Midori. \"I think they\\'re \\ngreat!\"\\n she said. There was also a sound for a penis moving in and out of a vagina. I\\nhad never realized that such sounds even existed. The man was into a\\nlot of heavy breathing, and the woman came up with the usual sort of\\nexpressions - \"Yes!\" or \"More!\" - as she writhed under him. You\\ncould also hear the bed creaking. These scenes just went on and on.\\nMidori seemed to be enjoying them at first, but even she got bored\\nafter a while and suggested we leave. We went outside and took a few\\ndeep breaths. This was the first time in my life the outside air of\\nShinjuku felt healthy to me. \"That was fun,\" said Midori. \"Let\\'s try it again sometime.\" \"They just keep doing the same things,\" I said. \"Well, what else can they do? We all just keep doing the same things.\"\\nShe had a point there. We found another bar and ordered drinks. I had more whisky, and\\nMidori drank three or four cocktails of some indefinable kind. Outside\\nagain, Midori said she wanted to climb a tree. \"There aren\\'t any trees around here,\" I said. \"And even if there were,\\nyou\\'re too wobbly to do any climbing.\" \"You\\'re always so damn sensible, you ruin everything. I\\'m drunk\\n\\'cause I wanna be drunk. What\\'s wrong with that? And even if I \\nam\\ndrunk, I can still climb a tree. Shit, I\\'m gonna climb all the way to the\\ntop of a great, big, tall tree and I\\'m gonna pee all over everybody!\" \"You wouldn’t happen to need the toilet by any chance?\" \"Yup. I took Midori to a pay toilet in Shinjuku Station, put a coin in the slot\\nand bundled her inside, then bought an evening paper at a nearby\\nstand and read it while I waited for her to come out. But she didn’t\\ncome out. I started getting worried after 15 minutes and was ready to\\ngo and check on her when she finally emerged looking pale. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"I fell asleep.\" \"Are you OK?\" I asked, putting my coat around her shoulders. \"Not really,\" she said. \"I\\'ll take you home. You just have to get home, take a nice, long bath\\nand go to bed. You\\'re exhausted.\" \"I am \\nnot\\n going home. What\\'s the point? Nobody\\'s there. I don’t want\\nto sleep all by myself in a place like that.\" \"Terrific,\" I said. \"So what are you going to do?\" \"Go to some love hotel around here and sleep with your arms around\\nme all night. Like a log. Tomorrow morning we\\'ll have breakfast\\nsomewhere and go to lectures together.\" \"You were planning this all along, weren\\'t you? That\\'s why you called\\nme.\" \"Of course. \"You should have called your boyfriend, not me. That\\'s the only thing\\nthat makes sense. That\\'s what boyfriends are for.\" \"But I want to be with you.\" \"You can\\'t be with me,\" I said. \"First of all, I have to be back in the\\ndorm by midnight. Otherwise, I\\'ll break curfew. The one time I did that there was all hell to pay. And secondly, if I go to bed with a girl.\\nI\\'m going to want to do it with her, and the last thing I want is to lie\\nthere struggling to restrain myself. I\\'m not kidding, I might end up\\nforcing you.\" \"You mean you’d hit me and tie me up and rape me from behind?\" \"Hey, look. I\\'m serious.\" \"But I\\'m so lonely! I want to \\nbe\\n with someone! I know I\\'m doing\\nterrible things to you, making demands and not giving you anything in\\nreturn, saying whatever pops into my head, dragging you out of your\\nroom and forcing you to take me everywhere, but you\\'re the only one I\\ncan do stuff like that to! I\\'ve never been able to have my own way\\nwith anybody, not once in the 20 years I\\'ve been alive. My father, my\\nmother, they never paid the slightest attention to me, and my\\nboyfriend, well, he\\'s just not that kind of guy. He gets angry if I try to\\nhave my own way. So we end up fighting. You\\'re the only one I can\\nsay these things to. And now I\\'m really, really, really tired and I want\\nto fall asleep listening to someone tell me how much they like me and\\nhow pretty I am and stuff. That\\'s all I want. And when I wake up. I\\'ll\\nbe full of energy and I\\'ll never make these kinds of selfish demands\\nagain. I swear. I\\'ll be a good girl.\" \"I hear you, believe me, but there\\'s nothing I can do.\" \"Oh, please! Otherwise, I\\'m going to sit down right here on the ground\\nand cry my head off all night long. And I\\'ll sleep with the first guy that\\ntalks to me.\" That did it. I called the dorm and asked for Nagasawa. When he got to the phone I asked him if he would make it look as if I\\nhad come back for the evening. I was with a girl, I explained. \"Fine,\" he said. \"It\\'s a worthy cause. I\\'ll be glad to help you out. I\\'ll\\njust turn over your name tag to the \"in’ side. Don\\'t worry. Take all the\\ntime you need. You can come in through my window in the morning.\"\\n\"Thanks. I owe you one,\" I said and hung up. \"All set?\" Midori asked.\\n\"Pretty much,\" I said with a sigh. \"Great, let\\'s go to a disco, it\\'s so early.\" \"Wait a minute, I thought you were tired.\" \"For something like\\nthis. I\\'m just fine.\" \"Oh boy.\" And she was right. We went to a disco, and her energy came back\\nlittle by little as we danced. She drank two whisky and cokes, and\\nstayed on the dance floor until her forehead was drenched in sweat.\\n\"This is so much fun!\" she exclaimed when we took a break at a table.\\n\"I haven\\'t danced like this in ages. I don\\'t know, when you move your\\nbody, it\\'s kind of like your spirit gets liberated.\" \"Your spirit is always liberated. I\\'d say.\" \"No way,\" she said, shaking her head and smiling. \"Anyway, now that\\nI\\'m feeling better, I\\'m starved! Let\\'s go for a pizza.\" I took her to a pizzeria I knew and ordered draught beer and an\\nanchovy pizza. I wasn\\'t very hungry and ate only lour of the twelve\\nslices. Midori finished the rest. \"You sure made a fast recovery,\" I said. \"Not too long ago you were\\npale and wobbly.\" \"It\\'s because my selfish demands got through to somebody,,, she\\nanswered. \"It unclogged me. Wow, this pizza is great!\\', \"Tell me, though. Is there really nobody at home?\" \"It\\'s true. My sister\\'s staying at her friend\\'s place. Now, that girl\\'s got\\na real\\n case of the creeps. She can\\'t sleep alone in the house if I\\'m not\\nthere.\" \"Let\\'s forget this love hotel crap, then. Going to a place like that just\\nmakes you feel cheap. Let\\'s go to your house. You must have enough\\nbedding for me?\" Midori thought about it for a minute, then nodded. \"OK, we\\'ll spend\\nthe night at mine.\" We took the Yamanote Line to Otsuka, and soon we were raising the\\nmetal shutter that sealed off the front of the Kobayashi Bookshop. A\\npaper sign on the shutter read TEMPORARILY CLOSED. The smell\\nof old paper filled the dark shop, as if the shutter had not been opened\\nfor a long time. Half the shelves were empty, and most of the magazines had been tied in bundles for returns. That hollow, chilly\\nfeeling I had experienced on my first visit had only deepened. The\\nplace looked like a hulk abandoned on the shore. \"You\\'re not planning to open shop again?\" I asked. \"Nah, we\\'re going to sell it,\" said Midori. \"We\\'ll divide the money and\\nlive on our own for a while without anybody\\'s \"protection’. My sister\\'s\\ngetting married next year, and I\\'ve got three more years at university.\\nWe ought to make enough to see us through that much at least. I\\'ll\\nkeep my part-time job, too. Once the place is sold. I\\'ll live with my\\nsister in a flat for a while.\" \"You think somebody\\'ll want to buy it? \"Probably. I know somebody who wants to open a wool \\nshop,\\n She\\'s\\nbeen asking me recently if I want to sell. Poor Dad, though. He\\nworked so hard to get this place, and he was paying off the loan he\\ntook out little by little, and in the end he hardly had anything left. It all\\nmelted away, like foam on a river.\" \"He had \\nyou,\\n though,\" I said. \"Me?!\" Midori said with a laugh. She took a deep breath and let it out.\\n\"Let\\'s go upstairs. It\\'s cold down here.\" Upstairs, she sat me at the kitchen table and went to warm the bath\\nwater. While she busied herself with that, I put a kettle on to boil and\\nmade tea. Waiting for the tank to heat up, we sat across from each\\nother at the kitchen table and drank tea. Chin in hand, she took a long,\\nhard look at me. There were no sounds other than the ticking of the\\nclock and the hum of the fridge motor turning on and off as the\\nthermostat kicked in and out. The clock showed that midnight was fast\\napproaching. \"You know, Watanabe, study it hard enough, and you\\'ve got a pretty\\ninteresting face.\" \"Think so?\" I asked, a bit hurt. \"A nice face goes a long way with me,\" she said. \"And yours ... well,\\nthe more I look at it, the more I get to thinking, \"He\\'ll do\\'.\" \"Me, too,\" I said. \"Every once in a while, I think about myself, \"What\\nthe hell. I’ll do’.\" \"Hey, I don\\'t mean that in a bad way. I\\'m not very good at putting my\\nfeelings into words. That\\'s why people misunderstand me. All I\\'m\\ntrying to say is I like you. Have I told you that before?\" \"You have,\" I said. \"I mean. I\\'m not the only one who has trouble working out what men\\nare all about. But I\\'m getting there, a little at a time.\" Midori brought over a box of Marlboro and lit one up. \"When you\\nstart at zero, you\\'ve got a lot to learn.\" \"I wouldn’t be surprised.\" \"Oh, I almost forgot! You want to burn a stick of incense for my\\nfather?\" I followed Midori to the room with the Buddhist altar, lit a stick of\\nincense in front of her father\\'s photo, and brought my hands together.\\n\"Know what I did the other day?\" Midori asked. \"I got all naked in\\nfront of my father\\'s picture. Took off every stitch of clothing and let\\nhim have a good, long look. Kind of in a yoga position. Like, \"Here,\\nDaddy, these are my tits, and this is my cunt\\'.\" \"Why in the hell would you do something like that?\" I asked. \"I don\\'t know, I just wanted to show him. I mean, half of me comes\\nfrom his sperm, right? Why shouldn’t I show him? \"Here\\'s the\\ndaughter you made.\\' \\nI was\\n a little drunk at the time. I suppose that had\\nsomething to do with it.\" \"I suppose.\" \"My sister walked in and almost fell over. There I was in front of my\\nfather\\'s memorial portrait all naked with my legs spread. I guess you\\nwould be kind of surprised.\" \"I s\\'pose so.\" \"I explained why I was doing it and said. \"So take off your clothes too\\nMorno (her name\\'s Momo), and sit down next to me and show him,\\'\\nbut she wouldn\\'t do it. She went away shocked. She has this really\\nconservative streak.\" \"In other words, she’s relatively normal, you mean.\" \"Tell me, Watanabe, what did you think of my father?\" \"I\\'m not good with people I\\'ve just met, but it didn’t bother me being\\nalone with him. I felt pretty comfortable. We talked about all kinds of stuff.\" -What kind of stuff?\" -Euripides,\" I said. Midori laughed out loud. \"You\\'re so \\nweird! Nobody\\n talks about\\nEuripides with a dying person they\\'ve just met!\" ,,Well, nobody\\n sits in front of her father\\'s memorial portrait with her\\nlegs spread, either!\" Midori chuckled and gave the altar bell a ring. \"Night-night, Daddy.\\nWe\\'re going to have some fun now, so don’t worry and get some sleep.\\nYou\\'re not suffering any more, right? You\\'re dead, OK? I\\'m sure\\nyou\\'re not suffering. If you are, you\\'d better complain to the gods. Tell\\n\\'em it\\'s just too cruel. I hope you meet Mum and the two of you really\\ndo it. I saw your willy when I helped you pee. It was pretty\\nimpressive! So give it everything you\\'ve got. Goodnight.\" We took turns in the bath and changed into pyjamas. I borrowed a\\nnearly new pair of her father\\'s. They were a little small but better than\\nnothing. Midori spread out a mattress for me on the floor of the altar\\nroom. \"You\\'re not scared sleeping in front of the altar?\" she asked. \"Not at all. I haven\\'t done anything bad,\" I said with a smile. \"But you\\'re going to stay with me and hold me until I fall asleep,\\nright?\" \"Right,\" I said. Practically falling over the edge of Midori\\'s little bed, I held her in my\\narms. Nose against my chest, she placed her hands on my hips. My\\nright arm curled around her back while I tried to keep from falling out\\nby hanging on to the bed frame with my left hand. It was not exactly a situation conducive to sexual excitement. My nose was resting on her\\nhead and her short-cut hair would tickle every now and then. \"Come on. \\nsay\\n something to me,\" Midori said, her face buried in my\\nchest. \"What do you want me to say?\" \"Anything. Something to make me feel good.\" \"You\\'re really cute,\" I\\nsaid. \" - Midori,\" she said. \"Say my name.\" \"You\\'re really cute, Midori,\" I corrected myself. \"What do you mean\\nreally\\n cute?\" \"So cute the mountains crumble and the oceans dry up.\" Midori lifted\\nher face and looked at me. \"You have this special way with words.\" \"I can feel my heart softening when you say that,\" I said, smiling. \"Say something even nicer.\" \"I really like you, Midori. A lot.\" \"How much is a lot?\" \"Like a spring bear,\" I said. \"A spring bear?\" Midori looked up again. \"What\\'s that all about? A\\nspring bear.\" \"You\\'re walking through a field all by yourself one day in spring, and\\nthis sweet little bear cub with velvet fur and shiny little eyes comes\\nwalking along. And he says to you, \"Hi. there, little lady. Want to\\ntumble with me?\\' So you and the bear cub spend the whole day in each\\nother\\'s arms, tumbling down this clover-covered hill. Nice, huh?\"\\n\"Yeah. \\nReally\\n nice.\" \"That\\'s how much I like you.\" \"That is the best thing I\\'ve ever heard,\" said Midori, cuddling up\\nagainst my chest. \"If you like me \\nthat\\n much, you\\'ll do anything I tell\\nyou to do, right? You won\\'t get angry, right?\" \"No, of course not.\" \"And you\\'ll take care of me always and always.\" ,,0/course I will,\" I said, stroking her short, soft, boyish hair. \"Don’t worry, everything is going to be fine.\" \"But I\\'m scared,\" she said. I held her softly, and soon her shoulders were rising and falling, and I\\ncould hear the regular breathing of sleep. I slipped out of her bed and\\nwent to the kitchen, where I drank a beer. I wasn\\'t the least bit sleepy,\\nso I thought about reading a book, but I couldn’t find anything worth\\nreading nearby. I considered returning to Midori\\'s room to look for\\none, but I didn’t want to wake her by rummaging around while she\\nwas sleeping. I sat there staring into space for a while, sipping my beer, when it\\noccurred to me that I was in a bookshop. I went downstairs, switched\\non the light and started looking through the paperback shelves. There\\nwasn\\'t much that appealed to me, and most of what did I had read\\nalready, but I had to have something to read no matter what. I picked a\\ndiscoloured copy of Hermann Hesse\\'s \\nBeneath the Wheel\\n that must\\nhave been hanging around the shop unsold for a long time, and left the\\nmoney for it by the till. This was my small contribution to reducing\\nthe debts of the Kobayashi Bookshop. I sat at the kitchen table, drinking my beer and reading \\nBeneath the\\nWheel. I\\n had first read the novel the year I entered school. And now,\\nabout eight years later, here I was, reading the same book in a girl\\'s\\nkitchen, wearing the undersized pyjamas of her dead father. Funny. If\\nit hadn\\'t been for these strange circumstances, I would probably never\\nhave reread\\nBeneath the Wheel. The book did have its dated moments, but as a novel it wasn\\'t bad. I\\nmoved through it slowly, enjoying it line by line, in the hushed\\nbookshop in the middle of the night. A dusty bottle of brandy stood on\\na shelf in the kitchen. I poured a little into a coffee cup and sipped it.\\nIt warmed me but did nothing to help me feel sleepy. I went to check on Midori a little before three, but she was fast asleep.\\nShe must have been exhausted. The lights from the block of shops beyond the window cast a soft white glow, like moonlight, over the\\nroom. Midori slept with her back to the light. She lay so perfectly still,\\nshe might have been frozen stiff. Bending over, I caught the sound of\\nher breathing. She slept just like her father. The suitcase from her recent travels stood by the bed. Her white coat\\nhung on the back of a chair. Her desktop was neatly arranged, and on\\nthe wall over it hung a Snoopy calendar. I nudged the curtain aside\\nand looked down at the deserted shops. Every shop was closed, their\\nmetal shutters down, the vending machines hunched in front of the\\noff-licence the only sign of something waiting for the dawn. The moan\\nof longdistance lorry tyres sent a deep shudder through the air every\\nnow and then. I went back to the kitchen, poured myself another shot\\nof brandy, and went on reading \\nBeneath the Wheel. By the time I had finished it the sky was growing light. I made myself\\nsome instant coffee and used some notepaper and a ballpoint pen I\\nfound on the table to write a message to Midori: \\nI drank some of your\\nbrandy. I bought a copy\\n o/Beneath the Wheel. \\nIt\\'s light outside, so I\\'m\\ngoing home. Goodbye.\\n Then, after some hesitation, I wrote: \\nYou look\\nreally cute when you\\'re sleeping.\\n I washed my coffee cup, switched\\noff the kitchen light, went downstairs, quietly lifted the shutter, and\\nstepped outside. I worried that a neighbour might find me suspicious,\\nbut there was no one on the street at 5.50-something in the morning.\\nOnly the crows were on their usual rooftop perch, glaring down at the\\nstreet. I glanced up at the pale pink curtains in Midori\\'s window,\\nwalked to the tram stop, rode to the end of the line, and walked to my\\ndorm. On the way I found an \\nopen\\n cafe and ate a breakfast of rice and\\nmiso soup, pickled vegetables and fried eggs. Circling around to the\\nback of the dorm, I tapped on Nagasawa\\'s ground-floor window. He\\nlet me in immediately. \"Coffee?\" he asked. \"Nah.\" I thanked him, went up to my room, brushed my teeth, took my trousers off, got under the covers, and clamped my eyes shut. Finally,\\na dreamless sleep closed over me like a heavy lead door. I wrote to Naoko every week, and she often wrote back. Her letters\\nwere never very long. Soon there were references to the cold\\nNovember mornings and evenings. You went back to Tokyo just about the time the autumn weather was\\ndeepening, so for a time I couldn\\'t tell whether the hole that opened up\\ninside me was from missing you or from the change of the season.\\nReiko and I talk about you all the time. She says be sure to say \"Hi\" to\\nyou. She is as nice to me as ever. I don’t think I would have been able\\nto stand this place if I didn\\'t have her with me. I cry when I\\'m lonely.\\nReiko says it\\'s good I can cry. But feeling lonely really hurts. When\\nI\\'m lonely at night, people talk to me from the darkness. They talk to\\nme the way trees moan in the wind at night. Kizuki; my sister: they\\ntalk to me like that all the time. They\\'re lonely, too, and looking for\\nsomeone to talk to. I often reread your letters at night when I\\'m lonely and in pain. I get\\nconfused by a lot of things that come from outside, but your\\ndescriptions of the world around you give me wonderful relief. It\\'s so\\nstrange! I wonder why that should be? So I read them over and over,\\nand Reiko reads them, too. Then we talk about the things you tell me.\\nI really liked the part about that girl Midori\\'s father. We look forward\\nto getting your letter every week as one of our few entertainments -\\nyes, in a place like this, letters are our entertainments. I try my best to set aside a time in the week for writing to you, but\\nonce I actually sit down in front of the blank sheet of paper, I begin to\\nfeel depressed. I\\'m really having to push myself to write this letter,\\ntoo. Reiko\\'s been yelling at me to answer you. Don\\'t get me wrong,\\nthough. I have tons of things I want to talk to you about, to tell you\\nabout. It\\'s just hard for me to put them into words. Which is why it\\'s so painful for me to write letters. Speaking of Midori, she sounds like an interesting person. Reading\\nyour letter, I got the feeling she might be in love with you. When I\\ntold that to Reiko, she said, \"Well, of \\ncourse\\n she is! Even I am in love\\nwith Watanabe!\\' We\\'re picking mushrooms and gathering chestnuts\\nand eating them every day. And I do mean \\nevery\\n day: rice with\\nchestnuts, rice with matsutake mushrooms, but they taste so great, we\\nnever get tired of them. Reiko doesn\\'t eat that much, though. For her,\\nit’s still one cigarette after another. The birds and the rabbits are doing\\nfine. Goodbye. Three days after my twentieth birthday, a package arrived for me from\\nNaoko. Inside I found a wine-coloured crew neck pullover and a\\nletter. Happy Birthday! I hope you have a happy year being 20. My own year\\nof being 20 looks like it’s going to end with me as miserable as ever,\\nbut I\\'d really like it if you could have your share of happiness and\\nmine combined. Really. Reiko and I each knitted half of this jumper.\\nIf I had done it all by myself, it would have taken until next\\nValentine\\'s Day. The good half is Reiko\\'s, and the bad half is mine.\\nReiko is so good at everything she does, I sometimes hate myself\\nwhen I\\'m watching her. I mean, there\\'s not a single thing I\\'m really\\ngood at! Goodbye. Be well. The package had a short note from Reiko, too. How are you? For you, Naoko may be the pinnacle of happiness, but\\nfor me she\\'s just a clumsy girl. Still, we managed to finish this jumper\\nin time for your birthday. Handsome, isn\\'t it? We chose the colour and the style. Happy Birthday. Thinking back on the year 1969, all that comes to mind for me is a\\nswamp - a deep, sticky bog that feels as if it\\'s going to suck off my\\nshoe each time I take a step. I walk through the mud, exhausted. In\\nfront of me, behind me, I can see nothing but the endless darkness of a\\nswamp. Time itself slogged along in rhythm with my faltering steps. The\\npeople around me had gone on ahead long before, while my time and I\\nhung back, struggling through the mud. The world around me was on\\nthe verge of great transformations. Death had already taken John\\nColtrane who was joined now by so many others. People screamed\\nthere\\'d be revolutionary changes - which always seemed to be just\\nahead, at the curve in the road. But the \"changes\" that came were just\\ntwo-dimensional stage sets, backdrops without substance or meaning.\\nI trudged along through each day in its turn, rarely looking up, eyes\\nlocked on the never-ending swamp that lay before me, planting my\\nright foot, raising my left, planting my left foot, raising my right,\\nnever sure where I was, never sure I was headed in the right direction,\\nknowing only that I had to keep moving, one step at a time. I turned 20, autumn gave way to winter, but in my life nothing\\nchanged in any significant way. Unexcited, I went to my lectures,\\nworked three nights a week in the record shop reread \\nThe Great\\nGatsby\\n now and then, and when Sunday came I would do my washing\\nand write a long letter to Naoko. Sometimes I would go out with\\nMidori for a meal or to the \\nzoo or\\n to the cinema. The sale of the\\nKobayashi Bookshop went as planned, and Midori and her sister\\nmoved into a two-bedroom flat near Myogadani, a more upmarket\\nneighbourhood. Midori would move out when her sister got married,\\nand rent a flat by herself, she said. Meanwhile, she invited me to their new place for lunch once. It was a sunny, handsome flat, and Midori\\nseemed to enjoy living there far more than she had above the\\nKobayashi Bookshop. Every once in a while, Nagasawa would suggest that we go out on one\\nof our excursions, but I always found something else to do instead. I\\njust didn\\'t want the hassle. Not that I didn\\'t like the idea of sleeping\\nwith girls: it was just that, when I thought about the whole process I\\nhad to go through - drinking in town, looking for the right kind of\\ngirls, talking to them, going to a hotel - it was all too much effort. I\\nhad to admire Nagasawa all the more for the way he could continue\\nthe ritual without ever getting sick and tired of it. Maybe what\\nHatsumi had said to me had had some effect: I could make myself feel\\nfar happier just thinking about Naoko than sleeping with some stupid,\\nanonymous girl. The sensation of Naoko’s fingers bringing me to\\nclimax in a grassy field remained vivid inside me. I wrote to her at the beginning of December to ask if it would be all\\nright for me to come and visit her during the winter holidays. An\\nanswer came from Reiko saying they would love to have me. She\\nexplained that Naoko was having trouble writing and that she was\\nanswering for her. I was not to take this to mean that Naoko was\\nfeeling especially bad: there was no need for me to worry. These\\nthings came in waves. When the holidays came, I stuffed my things into my rucksack, put on\\nsnow boots and set out for Kyoto. The odd doctor had been right: the\\nwinter mountains blanketed in snow were incredibly beautiful. As\\nbefore, I slept two nights in the flat with Naoko and Reiko, and spent\\nthree days with them doing much the same kind of things as before.\\nWhen the sun went down, Reiko would play her guitar and the three\\nof us would sit around talking. Instead of our picnic, we went crosscountry skiing. An hour of tramping through the woods on skis left us\\nbreathless and sweaty. We also joined the residents and staff shovelling snow when there was time. Doctor Miyata popped over to\\nour table at dinner to explain why people\\'s middle fingers are longer\\nthan their index fingers, while with toes it worked the other way. The\\ngatekeeper, Omura, talked to me again about Tokyo pork. Reiko\\nenjoyed the records I brought as gifts from the city. She transcribed a\\nfew tunes and worked them out on her guitar. Naoko was even less talkative than she had been in the autumn. When\\nthe three of us were together, she would sit on the sofa, smiling, and\\nhardly say a word. Reiko seemed to be chattering away to make up for\\nher. \"But don\\'t worry,\" Naoko told me. \"This is just one of those\\ntimes. It\\'s a lot more fun for me to listen to you two than to talk\\nmyself.\" Reiko gave herself some chores that took her out of the flat so that\\nNaoko and I could get in bed. I kissed her neck and shoulders and\\nbreasts, and she used her hands to bring me to climax as before.\\nAfterwards, holding her close, I told her how her touch had stayed\\nwith me these two months, that I had thought of her and masturbated.\\n\"You haven\\'t slept with anybody else?\" Naoko asked. \"Not once,\" I\\nsaid. \"All right, then, here’s something else for you to remember.\" She slid\\ndown and kissed my penis, then enveloped it in her warm mouth and\\nran her tongue all over it, her long, straight hair swaying over my\\nbelly and groin with each movement of her lips until I came a second\\ntime. \"Do you think you can remember that?\" she asked. \"Of course I can,\" I said. \"I\\'ll always remember it.\" I held her tight and slid my hand inside her panties, touching her still-\\ndry vagina. Naoko shook her head and pulled my hand away. We held\\neach other for a time, saying nothing. \"I\\'m thinking of getting out of the dorm when term ends and looking\\nfor a flat,\" I said. \"I\\'ve had it with dorm life. If I keep working part-\\ntime I can pretty much cover my expenses. How about coming to Tokyo to live with me, the way I suggested before?\" \"Oh, Tom, thank you. I\\'m so happy that you would ask me to do\\nsomething like that!\" \"It\\'s not that I think there\\'s anything wrong with this place,\" I said.\\n\"It\\'s quiet, the surroundings are perfect, and Reiko is a wonderful\\nperson. But it\\'s not a place to stay for a long time. It\\'s too specialized\\nfor a long stay. The longer you\\'re here, I\\'m sure, the harder it is to\\nleave.\" Instead of answering, Naoko turned her gaze to the outside. Beyond\\nthe window, there was nothing to see but snow. Snow clouds hung\\nlow and heavy in the sky, with only the smallest gap between them\\nand the snow-covered earth. \"Take your time, think it over,\" I said. \"Whatever happens. I\\'m going\\nto move by the end of March. Any time you decide you want to join\\nme, you can come.\" Naoko nodded. I wrapped my arms around her as carefully as if I had\\nbeen holding a work of art delicately fashioned from glass. She put\\nher arms around my neck. I was naked, and she wore only the\\nskimpiest white underwear. Her body was so beautiful, I could have\\nenjoyed looking at it all day. \"Why don’t I get wet?\" Naoko murmured. \"That one time was the only\\ntime it ever happened. The day of my twentieth birthday, that April.\\nThe night you held me in your arms. What is wrong with me?\" \"It\\'s strictly psychological. I\\'m sure,\" I said. \"Give it time. There\\'s no\\nhurry.\" \"All of my problems are strictly psychological,\" said Naoko. \"What if\\nI never get better? What if I can never have sex for the rest of my life?\\nCan you keep loving me just the same? Will hands and lips always be\\nenough for you? Or will you solve the sex problem by sleeping with\\nother girls?\" \"I\\'m a bom optimist,\" I said. Naoko sat up in bed and slipped on a T-shirt. She put a flannel shirt over this, and then climbed into her jeans. I put my clothes on, too. \"Let me think about it,\" said Naoko. \"And you think about it, too.\" \"I will,\" I said. \"And speaking of lips, what you did with them just\\nnow was great.\" She reddened slightly and gave a little smile. \"Kizuki used to say that,\\ntoo.\" \"He and I had pretty much the same tastes and opinions,\" I said,\\nsmiling. We sat across from each other at the kitchen table, drinking coffee and\\ntalking about the old days. She was beginning to talk more about\\nKizuki. She would hesitate, and choose her words carefully. Every\\nnow and then, the snow would fall for a while and stop. The sky never\\ncleared the whole three days I was there. \"I think I can get back here\\nin March,\" I said as I was leaving. I gave her one last, heavily padded\\nhug with my winter coat on, and kissed her on the lips. \"Goodbye,\"\\nshe said. 1970 - a year with a whole new sound to it - came along, and that put\\nan end to my teenage years. Now I could step out into a whole new\\nswamp. Then it was time for exams, and these I passed with relative\\nease. If you have nothing else to do and spend all your time going to\\nlectures, it takes no special skill to get through end-of-year exams.\\nSome problems arose in the dorm, though. A few guys active in one of\\nthe political factions kept their helmets and iron pipes hidden in their\\nrooms. They had a run-in with some of the baseball-players under the\\nwing of the dorm Head, as a result of which two of them were injured\\nand six expelled. The aftershock of the incident was felt for a long\\ntime, spawning minor fights on an almost daily basis. The atmosphere\\nthat hung over the dorm was oppressive, and people\\'s nerves were on\\nedge. I myself was on the verge of getting knocked out by one of the\\nbaseball-players when Nagasawa intervened and managed to smooth\\nthings over. In any case, it was time for me to get out of there. Once most of my exams were out of the way, I started looking for a\\nflat in earnest. After a week of searching, I came up with the right\\nplace way out in the suburbs of Kichijoji. The location was not exactly\\nconvenient, but it was a house: an independent house - a real find.\\nOriginally a gardener\\'s shack or some other kind of cottage, it stood\\nby itself in the corner of a good-sized plot of land, separated from the\\nmain house by a large stretch of neglected garden. The landlord would\\nuse the front gate, and I the back, which would make it possible for\\nme to preserve my privacy. It had one good-sized room, a little\\nkitchen and bathroom, and an unimaginably huge closet. It even had a veranda facing the garden. A nice old couple were\\nrenting the house at way below market value on condition that the\\ntenant was prepared to move out the following year if their grandson\\ndecided to come to Tokyo. They assured me that I could live as I\\npleased there; they wouldn’t make any demands. Nagasawa helped me with the move. He managed to borrow a van to\\ntransfer my stuff, and, as promised, he gave me his fridge, TV, and\\noversize thermos flask. He might not need them any more, but for me\\nthey were perfect. He himself was scheduled to move out in two days,\\nto a flat in the Mita neighbourhood. \"I guess we won\\'t be seeing each other for a long time,\" he said as he\\nleft me, \"so keep well. I\\'m still sure we\\'ll run across each other in\\nsome strange place years from now.\" \"I\\'m already looking forward to it,\" I said. \"And that time we switched girls, the funny-looking one was way\\nbetter.\" \"Right on,\" I said with a laugh. \"But anyway, Nagasawa, take care of\\nHatsumi. Good ones like her are hard to find. And she\\'s a lot more\\nfragile than she looks.\" \"Yeah, I know,\" he said, nodding. \"That\\'s why I was hoping you\\nwould take her when I was through. The two of you would make a great couple.\" \"Yeah, right!\" I said. \"Just kidding,\" said Nagasawa. \"Anyway, be happy. I get the feeling a\\nlot of shit is going to come your way, but you\\'re a stubborn bastard.\\nI\\'m sure you\\'ll handle it. Mind if I give you one piece of advice?\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Don\\'t feel sorry for yourself,\" he said. \"Only arseholes do that.\" \"I\\'ll keep it in mind.\" I said. We shook hands and went our separate\\nways, he to his new world, and I back to my swamp. Three days after my move, I wrote to Naoko. I described my new\\nhouse and said how relieved I was to be away from the idiots in the\\ndorm and all their stupid brainstorms. Now I could start my new life\\nwith a new frame of mind. My window looks out on a big garden, which is used as a meeting\\nplace by all the neighbourhood cats. I like to stretch out on the\\nveranda and watch them. I\\'m not sure how many of them get together,\\nbut this is one big gang of cats. They sunbathe in groups. I don’t think\\nthey\\'re too pleased to see me living here, but once when I put out an\\nold chunk of cheese a few of them crept over and nibbled it. They\\'ll\\nprobably be friends of mine before too long. There\\'s one striped tom\\ncat in the bunch with half-eaten ears. It’s amazing how much he looks\\nlike my old dorm Head. I expect him to start raising the flag any day\\nnow. I’m kind of far from university here, but once I start my third year I\\nwon’t have too many morning lectures, so it shouldn\\'t be too bad. It\\nmay even be better with the time to read on the train. Now all I have\\nto do is find some easy work out here that I can do three or four days a\\nweek. Then I can get back to my springwinding life. I don\\'t want to rush, but April is a good time of year to start new\\nthings, and I can\\'t help feeling that the best thing for us would be to begin living together then. You could go back to university, too, if it\\nworked out well. If there\\'s a problem with us actually living together, I\\ncould find a flat for \\\\ou in the neighbourhood. The most important\\nthing is for us to be always near each other. It doesn\\'t \\nhave\\n to be\\nspring, of course. If you think summer is better, that\\'s fine by me, too.\\nJust let me know what you\\'re thinking, OK? I\\'m planning to put some extra time in at work for a while. To cover\\nmy moving expenses. I\\'m going to need a fair amount of money for\\none thing or another once I start living alone: pots and pans, dishes,\\nstuff like that. I\\'ll be free in March, though, and I definitely want to\\ncome to see you. What dates work best for you? I\\'ll plan a trip to\\nKyoto then. I look forward to seeing you and hearing your answer. I spent the next few days buying the things I needed in the nearby\\nKichijoji shopping district and started cooking simple meals for\\nmyself at home. I bought some planks at a local timber yard and had\\nthem cut to size so I could make a desk for myself. I thought I could\\nstudy on it and. for the time being, eat my meals there, too. I made\\nsome shelves and got in a good selection of spices. A white cat maybe\\nsix months old decided she liked me and started eating at my place. I\\ncalled her Seagull. Once I had my place sorted out to some extent, I went into town and\\nfound a temporary job as a painter\\'s assistant. I filled two solid weeks\\nthat way. The pay was good, but the work was murder, and the fumes\\nmade my head spin. Every day after work I\\'d eat at a cheap restaurant,\\nwash it down with beer, go home and play with the cat, then sleep like\\na dead man. No answer came from Naoko during that time. I was in the thick of painting when Midori popped into my mind. I\\nhadn\\'t been in touch with her for nearly three weeks, I realized, and hadn’t even told her I had moved. I had mentioned to\\nher that I was thinking of moving, and she had said, \"Oh, really?\" and\\nthat was the last time we had talked. I went to a phone box and dialled her number. The woman who\\nanswered was probably her sister. When I gave her my name, she said\\n\"Just a minute\", but Midori never came to the phone. Then the sister, or whoever she was, got back on the line. \"Midori\\nsays she\\'s too furious to talk to you. You just moved and never said a\\nthing to her, right? Just disappeared and never told her where you\\nwere going, right? Well, now you\\'ve got her boiling mad. And once\\nshe gets mad, she stays that way. Like some kind of animal.\" \"Look, could you just put her on the phone? I can explain.\" \"She says she doesn\\'t want to hear any explanations.\" \"Can I explain to \\nyou,\\n then? I hate to do this to you, but could you just\\nlisten and tell her what I said?\" \"Not \\nme!\\n Do it yourself. What kind of man are you? It\\'s \\nyour\\nresponsibility, so \\nyou\\n do it, and do it right.\" It was hopeless. I thanked her and hung up. I really couldn\\'t blame\\nMidori for being angry. What with all the moving and fixing up and\\nworking for extra cash, I hadn\\'t given her a second thought. Not even\\nNaoko had crossed my mind the whole time. This was nothing new\\nfor me. Whenever I get involved in something, I shut out everything\\nelse. But then I began to think how I would have felt if the tables had been\\nturned and Midori had moved somewhere without telling me where or\\ngetting in touch with me for three weeks. I would have been hurt -\\nhurt badly, no doubt. No, we weren\\'t lovers, but in a way we had\\nopened ourselves to each other even more deeply than lovers do. The\\nthought caused me a good deal of grief. What a terrible thing it is to\\nwound someone you really care for - and to do it so unconsciously. As soon as I got home from work, I sat at my new desk and wrote to\\nMidori. I told her how I felt as honestly as I could. I apologized,\\nwithout explanations or excuses, for having been so careless and\\ninsensitive. I miss you, I wrote. \\nI want to see you\\nas soon as possible. I want you to see my new house. Please write to me, 1\\n said, and sent the letter special delivery. The answer never came. This was the beginning of one weird spring. I spent the whole holiday\\nwaiting for letters. I couldn\\'t take a trip, I couldn\\'t go home to see my\\nparents, I couldn\\'t even take a part-time job because there was no\\ntelling when a letter might arrive from Naoko saying she wanted me to\\ncome and see her on such-and-such a date. Afternoons I would spend\\nin the nearby shopping district in Kichijoji, watching double bills or\\nreading in a jazz cafe. I saw no one and talked to almost no one. And\\nonce a week I would write to Naoko. I never suggested to her that I\\nwas hoping for an answer. I didn’t want to pressure her in any way. I\\nwould tell her about my painting job, about Seagull, about the peach\\nblossom in the garden, about the nice old lady who sold tofu, about\\nthe nasty old lady in the local restaurant, about the meals I was\\nmaking for myself. But still, she never wrote. Whenever I was fed up reading or listening to records, I would work a\\nlittle in the garden. From my landlord I borrowed a rake and broom\\nand pruning shears and spent my time pulling weeds and trimming\\nbushes. It didn\\'t take much to make the garden look good. Once the\\nowner invited me to join him for a cup of tea, so we sat on the veranda\\nof the main house drinking green tea and munching on rice crackers,\\nsharing small talk. After retirement, he had got a job with an insurance\\ncompany, he said, but he had left that, too, after a couple of years, and now he was taking it easy. The house\\nand land had been in the family for a long time, his children were\\ngrown-up and independent, and he could manage a comfortable old\\nage without working. Which is why he and his wife were always\\ntravelling together. \"That’s nice,\" I said. \"No it’s not,\" he answered. \"Travelling is no fun. I’d much rather be\\nworking.\" He let the garden grow wild, he said, because there were no decent gardeners in the area and because he had developed allergies that\\nmade it impossible for him to do the work himself. Cutting grass made\\nhim sneeze. When we had finished our tea, he showed me a storage shed and told\\nme I could use anything I found inside, more or less by way of thanks\\nfor my gardening. \"We don\\'t have any use for any of this stuff,\" he\\nsaid, \"so feel free.\" And in fact the place was crammed with all kinds of things - an old\\nwooden bath, a kids’ swimming pool, baseball bats. I found an old\\nbike, a handy-sized dining table with two chairs, a mirror, and a\\nguitar. \"I\\'d like to borrow these if you don\\'t mind,\" I said. \"Feel free,\" he said again. I spent a day working on the bike: cleaning the rust off, oiling the\\nbearings, pumping up the tyres, adjusting the gears, and taking it to a\\nbike repair shop to have a new gear cable installed. It looked like a\\ndifferent bike by the time I had finished. I cleaned a thick layer of dust\\noff the table and gave it a new coat of varnish. I replaced the strings of\\nthe guitar and glued a section of the body that was coming apart. I\\ntook a wire brush to the rust on the tuning pegs and adjusted those. It\\nwasn\\'t much of a guitar, but at least I got it to stay in tune. I hadn\\'t had\\na guitar in my hands since school, I realized. I sat on the porch and\\npicked my way through The Drifters\\' \"Up on the Roof\\' as well as I\\ncould. I was amazed to find I still remembered most of the chords. Next I took a few planks of wood and made myself a square letterbox.\\nI painted it red, wrote my name on it, and set it outside my door. Up\\nuntil 3 April, the only post that found its way to my box was\\nsomething that had been forwarded from the dorm: a notice from the\\nreunion committee of my school. A class reunion was the last thing I\\nwanted to have anything to do with. That was the class I had been in\\nwith Kizuki. I threw it in the bin. I found a letter in the box on the afternoon of 4 April. It said \\nReiko\\nIshida\\n on the back. I made a nice, clean cut across the seal with my scissors and went out to the porch to read it. I had a feeling this was\\nnot going to be good news, and I was right. First Reiko apologized for making me wait so long for an answer.\\nNaoko had been struggling to write me a letter, she said, but she could\\nnever seem to write one through to the end. I offered to send you an answer in her place, but every time I pointed\\nout how wrong it was of her to keep you waiting, she insisted that it\\nwas far too personal a matter, that she would write to you herself,\\nwhich is why I haven\\'t written sooner. I\\'m sorry, really. I hope you can\\nforgive me. I know you must have had a difficult month waiting for an answer, but\\nbelieve me, the month has been just as difficult for Naoko. Please try\\nto understand what she\\'s been going through. Her condition is not\\ngood, I have to say in all honesty. She was trying her best to stand on\\nher own two feet, but so far the results have not been good. Looking back, I see now that the first symptom of her problem was\\nher loss of the ability to write letters. That happened around the end of\\nNovember or beginning of December. Then she started hearing things.\\nWhenever she would try to write a letter, she would hear people\\ntalking to her, which made it impossible for her to write. The voices\\nwould interfere with her attempts to choose her words. It wasn\\'t all\\nthat bad until about the time of your second visit, so I didn\\'t take it too\\nseriously. For all of us here, these kinds of symptoms come in cycles,\\nmore or less. In her case, they got quite serious after you left. She is\\nhaving trouble now just holding an ordinary conversation. She can\\'t\\nfind the right words to speak, and that puts her into a terribly confused\\nstate - confused and frightened. Meanwhile, the \"things\" she\\'s hearing\\nare getting worse. We have a session every day with one of the specialists. Naoko and\\nthe doctor and I sit around talking and trying to find the exact part of\\nher that\\'s broken. I came up with the idea that it would be good to add you to one of our sessions if possible, and the doctor was in favour of\\nit, but Naoko was against it. I can tell you exactly what her reason\\nwas: \"I want my body to be clean of all this when I meet him.\" That\\nwas not the problem, I said to her; the problem was to get her well as\\nquickly as possible, and I pushed as hard as I could, but she wouldn’t\\nchange her mind. I think I once explained to you that this is not a specialized hospital.\\nWe do have medical specialists here, of course, and they provide\\neffective treatments, but concentrated therapy is another matter. The\\npoint of this place is to create an effective environment in which the\\npatient can treat herself or himself, and that does not, properly\\nspeaking, include medical treatment. Which means that if Naoko\\'s\\ncondition grows any worse, they will probably have to transfer her to\\nsome other hospital or medical facility or what have you. Personally, I\\nwould find this very painful, but we would have to do it. That isn’t to\\nsay that she couldn’t come back here for treatment on a kind of\\ntemporary \"leave of absence\". Or, better yet, she could even be cured\\nand finish with hospitals completely. In any case, we\\'re doing\\neverything we can, and Naoko is doing everything she can. The best\\nthing you can do meanwhile is hope for her recovery and keep sending\\nher those letters. It was dated 31 March. After I had read it, I stayed on the porch and\\nlet my eyes wander out to the garden, full now with the freshness of\\nspring. An old cherry tree stood there, its blossoms nearing the height\\nof their glory. A soft breeze blew, and the light of day lent its\\nstrangely blurred, smoky colours to everything. Seagull wandered\\nover from somewhere, and after scratching at the boards of the\\nveranda for a while, she stretched out next to me and fell asleep. I knew I should be doing some serious thinking, but I had no idea how\\nto go about it. And, to tell the truth, thinking was the last thing I\\nwanted to do. The time would come soon enough when I had no choice in the matter, and when that time came I would take a good,\\nlong while to think things over. Not now, though. Not now. I spent the day staring at the garden, propped against a pillar and\\nstroking Seagull. I felt completely drained. The afternoon deepened, twilight approached, and bluish shadows\\nenveloped the garden. Seagull disappeared, but I went on staring at the\\ncherry blossoms. In the spring gloom, they looked like flesh that had\\nburst through the skin over festering wounds. The garden filled up\\nwith the sweet, heavy stench of rotting flesh. And that\\'s when I\\nthought of Naoko\\'s flesh. Naoko\\'s beautiful flesh lay before me in the\\ndarkness, countless buds bursting through her skin, green and\\ntrembling in an almost imperceptible breeze. Why did such a beautiful\\nbody have to be so ill? I wondered. Why didn\\'t they just leave Naoko\\nalone? I went inside and drew my curtains, but even indoors there was no\\nescape from the smell of spring. It filled everything from the ground\\nup. But the only thing the smell of spring brought to mind for me now\\nwas that putrefying stench. Shut in behind my curtains, I felt a violent\\nloathing for spring. I hated what the spring had in store for me; I hated\\nthe dull, throbbing ache it aroused inside me. I had never hated\\nanything in my life with such intensity. I spent three full days after that all but walking on the bottom of the\\nsea. I could hardly hear what people said to me, and they had just as\\nmuch trouble catching anything I had to say. My whole body felt\\nenveloped in some kind of membrane, cutting off any direct contact\\nbetween me and the outside world. I couldn\\'t touch \"them\", and \"they\"\\ncouldn\\'t touch me. I was utterly helpless, and as long as I remained in\\nthat state, \"they\" were unable to reach out to me. I sat leaning against the wall, staring up at the ceiling. When I felt\\nhungry I would nibble anything within reach, drink some water, and\\nwhen the sadness of it got to me. I\\'d knock myself out with whisky. I\\ndidn\\'t bathe, I didn’t shave. This is how the three days went by. A letter came from Midori on 6 April. She invited me to meet her on\\ncampus and have lunch on the tenth when we had to enroll for\\nlectures. \\nI put off writing to you as long as I could, which makes us\\neven, so let\\'s make up. I have to admit it, I miss you. I read the letter again and again, four times all together, and still I\\ncouldn\\'t tell what she was trying to say to me. What could it possibly\\nmean? My brain was so fogged over, I couldn\\'t find the connection\\nfrom one sentence to the next. How would meeting her on enrolment\\nday make us \\n\"even\"?\\n Why did she want to have \\n\"lunch\"\\n with me? I\\nwas really losing it. My mind had gone slack, like the soggy roots of a\\nsubterranean plant. But somehow I knew I had to snap out of it. And\\nthen those words of Nagasawa’s came to mind: \"Don’t feel sorry for\\nyourself. Only arseholes do that.\" \"OK. Nagasawa. Right on,\" I heard myself thinking. I let out a sigh\\nand got to my feet. I did my laundry for the first time in weeks, went to the public bath\\nand shaved, cleaned my place up, shopped for food and cooked myself\\na decent meal for a change, fed the starving Seagull, drank only beer,\\nand did 30 minutes of exercise. Shaving, I discovered in the mirror\\nthat I was becoming emaciated. My eyes were popping. I could hardly\\nrecognize myself. I went out the next morning on a longish bike ride, and after finishing\\nlunch at home, I read Reiko’s letter one more time. Then thought\\nseriously about what I ought to do next. The main reason I had taken\\nReiko’s letter so hard was that it had upset my optimistic belief that\\nNaoko was getting better. Naoko herself had told me, \"My sickness is\\na lot worse than you think: it has far deeper roots.\" And Reiko had\\nwarned me there was no telling what might happen. Still, I had seen\\nNaoko twice, and had gained the impression she was on the mend. I had assumed that the only problem was whether she could regain the courage to return to the real world, and that if she managed\\nto, the two of us could join forces and make\\na go of it. Reiko\\'s letter smashed the illusory castle that I had built on that fragile\\nhypothesis, leaving only a flattened surface devoid of feeling. I would\\nhave to do something to regain my footing. It would probably take a\\nlong time for Naoko to recover. And even then, she would no doubt be\\nmore debilitated and would have lost even more of her self confidence\\nthan ever. I would have to adapt myself to this new situation. As\\nstrong as I might become, though, it would not solve all the problems.\\nI knew that much. But there was nothing else I could do: just keep my\\nown spirits up and wait for her to recover. Hey, there, Kizuki, I thought. Unlike you. I\\'ve chosen to live - and to\\nlive the best I know how. Sure, it was hard for you. What the hell, it\\'s\\nhard for \\nme.\\n Really hard. And all because you killed yourself and left\\nNaoko behind. But that\\'s something I will never do. I will never, ever,\\nturn my back on her. First of all, because I love her, and because I\\'m\\nstronger than she is. And I\\'m just going to keep on getting stronger.\\nI\\'m going to mature. I\\'m going to be an adult. Because that\\'s what I\\nhave to do. I always used to think I’d like to stay 17 or 18 if I could.\\nBut not any more. I\\'m not a teenager any more. I\\'ve got a sense of\\nresponsibility now. I\\'m not the same person I was when we used to\\nhang out together. I\\'m 20 now. And I have to pay the price to go on\\nliving. \"Shit, Watanabe, what happened to \\nyou?\"\\n Midori asked. \"You\\'re all\\nskin and bones!\" \"That bad, huh?\" \"Too much you-know-what with that married girlfriend of yours, I\\nbet.\" I smiled and shook my head. \"I haven\\'t slept with a girl since the beginning of October.\" \"Whew! That can\\'t be true. We\\'re talking six months here!\" \"You\\nheard me.\" \"So how did you lose so much weight?\" \"By growing up,\" I said. Midori put her hands on my shoulders and looked me in the eye with a\\ntwisted scowl that soon turned into a sweet smile. \"It\\'s true,\" she said.\\n\"Something\\'s kind of different. You\\'ve changed.\" \"I told you, I grew up. I\\'m an adult now.\" \"You\\'re fantastic, the way your brain works,\" she said as though\\ngenuinely impressed. \"Let\\'s eat. I\\'m starving.\" We went to a little restaurant behind the literature department. I\\nordered the lunch special and she did the same. \"Hey, Watanabe, are\\nyou mad at me?\" \"What for?\" \"For not answering you, just to get even. Do you think I shouldn’t\\nhave done that? I mean, you apologized and everything.\" \"Yeah, but it was my fault to begin with. That\\'s just how it goes.\" \"My sister says I shouldn\\'t have done it. That it was too unforgiving,\\ntoo childish.\" \"Yeah, but it made you feel better, didn\\'t it, getting even like that?\"\\n\"Uh-huh.\" \"OK. then, that\\'s that.\" \"You are\\n forgiving, aren\\'t you?\" Midori said. \"But tell me the truth,\\nWatanabe, you haven\\'t had sex for six months?\" \"Not once.\" \"So, that time you put me to bed, you must have really wanted it bad.\"\\n\"Yeah, I guess I did.\" \"But you didn\\'t do it, did you?\" \"Look, you\\'re the best friend I’ve got now,\" I said. \"I don\\'t want to lose\\nyou.\" \"You know, if you \\nhad\\n tried to force yourself on me that time, I\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to resist, I was so exhausted.\" \"But I was too big and hard,\" I said. Midori smiled and touched my wrist. \"A little before that, I decided I\\nwas going to believe in you. A hundred per cent. That\\'s how I\\nmanaged to sleep like that with total peace of mind. I knew I\\'d be all\\nright. I\\'d be safe with you there. And \\nI did\\n sleep like a log, didn’t I?\"\\n\"You sure did.\" \"On the other hand, if you were to say to me, \"Hey, Midori, let\\'s do it.\\nThen everything\\'ll be great,\\' I’d probably do it with you. Now, don\\'t\\nthink I\\'m trying to seduce you or tease you. I\\'m just telling you what\\'s\\non my mind, with total honesty.\" \"I know, I know.\" While we ate lunch, we showed each other our enrolment cards and\\nfound that we had enrolled for two of the same courses. So I’d be\\nseeing her twice a week at least. With that out of the way, Midori told\\nme about her living arrangements. For a while, neither she nor her\\nsister could get used to living in a flat - because it was too easy, she\\nsaid. They had always been used to running around like mad every\\nday, taking care of sick people, helping out at the bookshop, and one\\nthing or another. \"We\\'re finally getting used to it, though,\" she said. \"This is the way we\\nshould have been living all along - not having to worry about anyone\\nelse\\'s needs, just stretching out any way we felt like it. It made us both\\nnervous at first, as if our bodies were floating a few inches off the\\nground. It didn’t seem real, like real life couldn’t actually be like that.\\nWe were both tense, as though everything was about to be tipped\\nupside down any minute.\" \"A couple of worriers,\" I said with a smile. \"Well, it\\'s just that life has been so cruel to us until now,\" Midori said. \"But that\\'s OK. We\\'re going to get back every thing it\\nowes us.\" \"I bet you are,\" I said, \"knowing you. But tell me, what\\'s your sister\\ndoing these days?\" \"A friend of hers opened this swanky accessory shop a little while ago. My sister helps out there three times a week. Otherwise, she\\'s\\nstudying cookery, going on dates with her fiance, going to the cinema,\\nvegging out, and just enjoying life. Midori then asked about my new life. I gave her a description of the\\nlayout of the house, and the big garden and Seagull the cat, and my\\nlandlord. \"Are you enjoying yourself?\" she asked. \"Pretty much,\" I said. \"Could have fooled me,\" said Midori. \"Yeah, and it\\'s springtime, too,\" I said. \"And you\\'re wearing that cool pullover your girlfriend knitted for\\nyou.\" With a sudden shock I glanced down at my wine-coloured jumper.\\n\"How did you know?\" \"You\\'re as honest as they come,\" said Midori. \"I\\'m guessing, of\\ncourse! Anyway, what\\'s wrong with you?\" \"I don\\'t know. I\\'m trying to whip up a little enthusiasm.\" \"Just\\nremember, life is a box of chocolates.\" I shook try head a few times and looked at her. \"Maybe I\\'m not so\\nsmart, but sometimes I don\\'t know what on earth you\\'re talking\\nabout.\" \"You know, they\\'ve got these chocolate assortments, and you like\\nsome but you don\\'t like others? And you eat all the ones you like, and\\nthe only ones left are the ones you don\\'t like as much? I always think\\nabout that when something painful comes up. \"Now I just have to\\npolish these off, and everything\\'ll be OK.\\' Life is a box of chocolates.\" \"I suppose you could call it a philosophy.\" \"It\\'s true, though. I\\'ve learned it from experience.\" We were drinking our coffee when two girls came in. Midori seemed\\nto know them from university. The three of them compared enrolment\\ncards and talked about a million different things: \"What kind of mark did you get in German?\" \"So-and-so got hurt in the campus riots.\"\\n\"Great shoes, where did you buy them?\" I half-listened, but it felt as\\nthough their comments were coming from the other side of the world.\\nI sipped my coffee and watched the scene passing by the shop\\nwindow. It was a typical university springtime scene as the new year\\nwas getting under way: a haze hanging in the sky, the cherry trees\\nblooming, the new students (you could tell at a glance) carrying\\narmloads of new books. I felt myself difting off a little and thought\\nabout Naoko, unable to return to her studies again this year. A small\\nglass full of anemones stood by the window. When the other two went back to their table, Midori and I left to walk\\naround the neighbourhood. We visited a few second-hand bookshops,\\nbought some books, went to another cafe for another cup, played some\\npinball at an arcade, and sat on a park bench, talking - or, rather,\\nMidori talked while I merely grunted in response. When she said she\\nwas thirsty, I ran over to a newsagent\\'s and bought us two Cokes. I\\ncame back to find her scribbling away with her ballpoint pen on some\\nruled paper. \"What\\'s that?\" I asked. \"Nothing,\" she said. \"I have to go,\" she announced at 3.30. \"I\\'m supposed to meet my sister\\nat the Ginza.\" We walked to the subway station and went off in different directions.\\nAs she left, Midori stuffed the piece of paper, now folded in four, into\\nmy pocket. \"Read this when you get home,\" she said. I read it on the\\ntrain. I\\'m writing this letter to you while you\\'re off buying drinks. This is the\\nfirst time in my life I\\'ve ever written a letter to somebody sitting next\\nto me on a bench, but I feel it\\'s the only way I can get through to you.\\nI mean, you\\'re hardly listening to anything I say. Am I right? Do jou realize you did something terrible to me today? You never even noticed that my hairstyle had changed, did you? I\\'ve been\\nworking on it forever, trying to grow it out, and finally, at the end of\\nlast week, I managed to get it into a style you could actually call\\ngirlish, but you never even noticed. It was looking pretty good, so I\\nthought I\\'d give you a little shock when you saw me for the first time\\nafter so long, but it didn’t even register with you. Don\\'t you think that\\'s\\nawful? I bet you can\\'t even remember what I was wearing today. Hey,\\nI\\'m a girl! So what if you\\'ve got something on your mind? You can\\nspare me one decent look! All you had to say was \"Cute hair\", and I\\nwould have been able to forgive you for being sunk in a million\\nthoughts, but no! Which is why I\\'m going to tell you a lie. It\\'s not true that I have to\\nmeet my sister at the Ginza. I was planning to spend the night at your\\nplace. I even brought my pyjamas with me. It\\'s true. I\\'ve got my\\npyjamas and a toothbrush in my bag. I\\'m such an idiot! I mean, you\\nnever even invited me over to see your new place. Oh well, what the\\nhell, you obviously want to be alone, so I\\'ll leave you alone. Go ahead\\nand think away to your heart\\'s content! But don\\'t get me wrong. I\\'m not totally mad at you. I\\'m just sad. You\\nwere so nice to me when I was having my problems, but now that\\nyou\\'re having yours, it seems there\\'s not a thing I can do for you.\\nYou\\'re all locked up in that little world of yours, and when I try\\nknocking on the door, you just sort of look up for a second and go\\nright back inside. So now I see you coming back with our drinks - walking and thinking.\\nI was hoping you’d trip, but you didn\\'t. Now you\\'re sitting next to me\\ndrinking your Coke. I was holding out one last hope that you’d notice\\nand say \"Hey, your hair\\'s changed!\" but no. If you had, I would have\\ntom up this letter and said: \"Let\\'s go to your place. I\\'ll make you a nice\\ndinner. And afterwards we can go to bed and cuddle.\" But you\\'re\\nabout as sensitive as a steel plate. Goodbye. PS. Please don\\'t talk to me next time we meet. I rang Midori\\'s flat from the station when I got off the train in\\nKichijoji, but there was no answer. With nothing better to do, I\\nambled around the neighbourhood looking for some part-time work I\\ncould take after lectures began. I would be free all day Saturday and\\nSunday and could work after five o\\'clock on Mondays, Wednesdays\\nand Thursdays; but finding a job that fitted my particular schedule was\\nno easy matter. I gave up and went home. When I went out to buy\\ngroceries for dinner, I tried Midori\\'s place again. Her sister told me\\nthat Midori hadn\\'t come home yet and that she had no idea when she\\'d\\nbe back. I thanked her and hung up. After eating, I tried to write to Midori, but I gave up after several false\\nstarts and wrote to Naoko instead. Spring was here, I said, and the new university year was starting. I\\ntold her I missed her, that I had been hoping, one way or another, to be\\nable to meet her and talk. \\nIn any case, I wrote. \\nI\\'ve decided to make myself strong. As far as I can tell, that\\'s\\nall I can do. There\\'s one other thing. Maybe it\\'s just to do with me, and you may\\nnot care about this one way or another, but I\\'m not sleeping with\\nanybody any more. It\\'s because I don\\'t want to forget the last time you\\ntouched me. It meant a lot more to me than you might think. I think\\nabout it all of the time. I put the letter in an envelope, stuck on a stamp, and sat at my desk a\\nlong while staring at it. It was a much shorter letter than usual, but I\\nhad the feeling that Naoko might understand me better that way. I\\npoured myself an inch-and-a-half of whisky, drank it in two swallows,\\nand went to sleep. The next day I found a job near Kichijoji Station that I could do on Saturdays and Sundays: waiting on tables at a smallish Italian\\nrestaurant. The conditions were pretty poor, but travel\\nand lunch expenses were included. And whenever somebody on the\\nlate shift took the day off on a Monday, Wednesday or Thursday\\n(which happened often) I could take their place. This was perfect for\\nme. The manager said they would raise my pay when I had stayed for\\nthree months, and they wanted me to start that Saturday. He was a\\nmuch more decent guy than the idiot who ran the record shop in\\nShinjuku. I tried phoning Midori\\'s flat again, and again her sister answered.\\nMidori hadn\\'t come back since yesterday, she said, sounding tired, and\\nnow she herself was beginning to worry: did I have any idea where\\nshe might have gone? All I knew was that Midori had her pyjamas and\\na toothbrush in her bag. I saw Midori at the lecture on Wednesday. She was wearing a deep\\ngreen pullover and the dark sunglasses she had often worn that\\nsummer. She was seated in the last row, talking with a thin girl with\\nglasses I had seen once before. I approached her and said I’d like to\\ntalk afterwards. The girl with glasses looked at me first, and then\\nMidori looked at me. Her hairstyle was, in fact, somewhat more\\nfeminine than it had been before: more mature. \"I have to meet someone,\" she said, cocking her head slightly. \"I won\\'t take up much of your time,\" I said. \"Five minutes.\" Midori removed her sunglasses and narrowed her eyes. She might just\\nas well have been looking at a crumbling, abandoned house some\\nhundred yards in the distance. \"I don’t want to talk to you. Sorry,\" she said. The girl with glasses looked at me with eyes that said: She says she\\ndoesn\\'t want to talk to you. Sorry. I sat at the right end of the front row for the lecture (an overview of the works of Tennessee Williams and their place in American\\nliterature), and when it was over, I did a long count to three and turned\\naround. Midori was gone. April was too lonely a month to spend all alone. In April, everyone\\naround me looked happy. People would throw off their coats and\\nenjoy each other\\'s company in the sunshine - talking, playing catch,\\nholding hands. But I was always by myself. Naoko, Midori,\\nNagasawa: all of them had gone away from where I stood. Now I had\\nno one to say \"Good morning\" to or \"Have a nice day\". I even missed\\nStorm Trooper. I spent the whole month with this hopeless sense of\\nisolation. I tried to speak to Midori a few times, but the answer I got\\nfrom her was always the same: \"I don’t want to talk to you now\" - and\\nI knew from the tone of her voice that she meant it. She was always\\nwith the girl with glasses, or else I saw her with a tall, short-haired\\nguy. He had these incredibly long legs and always wore white\\nbasketball shoes. April ended and May came along, but May was even worse than\\nApril. In the deepening spring of May, I had no choice but to\\nrecognize the trembling of my heart. It usually happened as the sun\\nwas going down. In the pale evening gloom, when the soft fragrance\\nof magnolias hung in the air, my heart would swell without warning,\\nand tremble, and lurch with a stab of pain. I would try clamping my\\neyes shut and gritting my teeth, and wait for it to pass. And it \\nwould\\npass - but slowly, taking its own time, and leaving a dull ache in its\\npath. At those times I would write to Naoko. In my letters to her, I would\\ndescribe only things that were touching or pleasant or beautiful: the\\nfragrance of grasses, the caress of a spring breeze, the light of the\\nmoon, a film I’d seen, a song I liked, a book that had moved me. I\\nmyself would be comforted by letters like this when I would reread what I had written. And I would\\nfeel that the world I lived in was a wonderful one. I wrote any number of letters like this, but from Naoko or Reiko I heard nothing. At the restaurant where I worked I got to know another student my\\nage named Itoh. It took quite a while before this gentle, quiet student\\nfrom the oil-painting department of an art college would engage me in\\nconversation, but eventually we started going to a nearby bar after\\nwork and talking about all kinds of things. He also liked to read and to\\nlisten to music, so we\\'d usually talk about books and records we liked.\\nHe was a slim, good-looking guy with much shorter hair and far\\ncleaner clothes than the typical art student. He never had a lot to say,\\nbut he had his definite tastes and opinions. He liked French novels,\\nespecially those of Georges Bataille and Boris Vian. For music, he\\npreferred Mozart and Ravel. And, like me, he was looking for a friend\\nwith whom he could talk about such things. Itoh once invited me to his flat. It was not quite as hard to get to as\\nmine: a strange, one-floored house behind Inokashira Park. His room\\nwas stuffed with painting supplies and canvases. I asked to see his\\nwork, but he said he was too embarrassed to show me anything. We\\ndrank some Chivas Regal that he had quietly removed from his\\nfather\\'s place, grilled some smelts on his charcoal stove, and listened\\nto Robert Casadesus playing a Mozart piano concerto. Itoh was from Nagasaki. He had a girlfriend he would sleep with\\nwhenever he went home, he said, but things weren\\'t going too well\\nwith her lately. \"You know what girls are like,\" he said. \"They turn 20 or 21 and all of\\na sudden they start having these concrete ideas. They get super-\\nrealistic. And when that happens, everything that seemed so sweet and\\nloveable about them begins to look ordinary and depressing. Now\\nwhen I see her, usually after we do it, she starts asking me, \"What are\\nyou going to do after you graduate?\"\\' \"Well, what \\nare\\n you going to do after you graduate?\" I asked him.\\nMunching on a mouthful of smelt, he shook his head. \"What \\ncan I\\n do?\\nI\\'m in oil painting! Start worrying about stuff like that, and \\nnobody\\'s going to study oil painting! You don\\'t do it to feed yourself. So she\\'s\\nlike, \"Why don’t you come back to Nagasaki and become an art\\nteacher?\\' She\\'s planning to be an English teacher.\" \"You\\'re not so crazy about her any more, are you?\" \"That just about sums it up,\" Itoh admitted. \"And who on earth wants\\nto be an art teacher? I\\'m not gonna spend my whole fuckin\\' life\\nteaching teenaged monkeys how to draw!\" \"That\\'s beside the point,\" I said. \"Don’t you think you ought to break\\nup with her? For both your sakes.\" \"Sure I do. But I don\\'t know how to say it to her. She\\'s planning to\\nspend her life with me. How the hell can I say, \"Hey, we ought to split\\nup. I don\\'t like you any more\\'?\" We drank our Chivas straight, without ice, and when we ran out of\\nsmelts we cut up some cucumbers and celery and dipped them in\\nmiso. When my teeth crunched down on my cucumber slices, I\\nthought of Midori\\'s father, which reminded me how flat and tasteless\\nmy life had become without Midori and this put me in a foul mood.\\nWithout my being aware of it, she had become a huge presence inside\\nme. \"Got a girlfriend ?\" asked Itoh. \"Yeah,\" I said, then, after a pause added, \"but I can\\'t be with her at the\\nmoment.\" \"But you understand each other\\'s feelings, right?\" \"I like to think so. Otherwise, what\\'s the point?\" I said with a chuckle.\\nItoh talked in hushed tones about the greatness of Mozart. He knew\\nMozart inside out, the way a country boy knows his mountain trails.\\nHis father loved the music and had exposed him to it ever since he\\nwas tiny. I didn’t know so much about classical music, but listening to\\nthis Mozart concerto with Itoh\\'s smart and heartfelt commentary\\n(\"There - that part,\" \"How about \\nthat?\"), I\\n felt myself calming down\\nfor the first time in ages. We stared at the crescent moon hanging over\\nInokashira Park and drank our Chivas Regal to the last drop. Fantastic whisky. Itoh said I could spend the night there, but I told him I had to do\\nsomething, thanked him for the whisky and left his flat before nine.\\nOn the way back to my place I called Midori from a phone box. Much\\nto my surprise she actually answered. \"Sorry,\" she said, \"but I don\\'t want to talk to you right now.\" \"I know, I know. But I don\\'t want our relationship to end like this.\\nYou\\'re one of the very few friends I have, and it hurts not being able\\nto see you. When \\nam I\\n going to be able to talk to you? I want you to\\ntell me that much, at least.\" \"When \\nI\\n feel like talking to \\nyou,\"\\n she said. \"How are you?\" I asked. \"Fine,\" she said, and hung up. A letter came from Reiko in the middle of May. Thanks for writing so often. Naoko enjoys your letters. And so do I.\\nYou don\\'t mind if I read them, do you? Sorry I haven\\'t been able to answer for such a long time. To tell you\\nthe truth. I’ve been feeling a bit exhausted, and there hasn\\'t been much\\ngood news to report. Naoko’s not doing well. Her mother came from\\nKobe the other day. The four of us - she and Naoko and the doctor and\\nI - had a good, long talk and we reached the conclusion that Naoko\\nshould move to a real hospital for a while for some intensive treatment\\nand then maybe come back here depending on the results. Naoko says\\nshe’d like to stay here if possible and make herself well, and I know I\\nam going to miss her and worry about her, but the fact is that it’s\\ngetting harder and harder to keep her under control here. She’s fine\\nmost of the time, but sometimes her emotions become extremely\\nunstable, and when that happens we can’t take our eyes off her.\\nThere’s no telling what she would do. When she has those intense\\nepisodes of hearing voices, she shuts down completely and burrows inside herself. Which is why I myself agree that the best thing for Naoko would be\\nfor her to receive therapy at a proper institution for a while. I hate to\\nsay it, but it\\'s all we can do. As I told you once before, patience is the\\nmost important thing. We have to go on unravelling the jumbled\\nthreads one at a time, without losing hope. No matter how hopeless\\nher condition may appear to be, we are bound to find that one loose\\nthread sooner or later. If you\\'re in pitch blackness, all you can do is sit\\ntight until your eyes get used to the dark. Naoko should have moved to that other hospital by the time you\\nreceive this. I\\'m sorry I waited to tell you until the decisions had been\\nmade, but it happened very quickly. The new hospital is a really good\\none, with good doctors. I\\'ll write the address below: please write to Naoko\\nthere. They will be keeping me informed of her progress, too, so I will\\nlet you know what I hear. I hope it will be good news. I know this is\\ngoing to be hard for you, but keep your hopes up. And even though\\nNaoko is not here any more, please write to me once in a while.\\nGoodbye. I wrote a huge number of letters that spring: one a week to Naoko,\\nseveral to Reiko, and several more to Midori. I wrote letters in the\\nlecture hall, I wrote letters at my desk at home with Seagull on my lap,\\nI wrote letters at empty tables during my breaks at the Italian\\nrestaurant. It was as if I were writing letters to hold together the pieces\\nof my crumbling life. To Midori I wrote: \\nApril and May were painful, lonely months for me\\nbecause I couldn\\'t talk to you. I never knew that spring could be so\\npainful and lonely. Better to have three Februaries than a spring like\\nthis. I know it\\'s too late to be saying this, but your new hairstyle looks\\ngreat on you. Really cute. I\\'m working at an Italian restaurant now,\\nand the cook taught me a great way to make spaghetti. I\\'d like to make it for you soon. I went to the university every day, worked in the restaurant two or\\nthree times a week, talked with Itoh about books and music, read a\\nfew Boris Vian novels he lent me, wrote letters, played with Seagull,\\nmade spaghetti, worked in the garden, masturbated thinking of Naoko,\\nand saw lots of films. It was almost the middle of June by the time Midori started talking to\\nme. We hadn\\'t said a word to each other for two months. After the end\\nof one lecture, she sat down next to me, propped her chin in her hand,\\nand sat there, saying nothing. Beyond the window, it was raining - a really rainy-season rain,\\npouring straight down without any wind, soaking every single thing\\nbeneath. Long after the other students had filed out of the classroom,\\nMidori went on sitting next to me without a word. Then she took a\\nMarlboro from the pocket of her jeans jacket, put it between her lips,\\nand handed me her matches. I struck a match and lit her cigarette.\\nMidori pursed her lips and blew a gentle cloud of tobacco in my face.\\n\"Like my hairstyle?\" she asked. \"It\\'s great.\" \"How great?\" \"Great enough to knock down all the trees in all the forests of the\\nworld.\" \"You really think so?\" \"I really think so.\" She kept her eyes on mine for a while, then held her right hand out to\\nme. I took it. She looked even more relieved than I felt. She tapped\\nher ashes onto the floor and rose to her feet. \"Let’s eat. I’m starving,\" she said. \"Where do you want to go?\" I asked. \"To the restaurant of the Takashimaya department store in Nihonbashi.\" \"Why \\nthere\\n of all places?\" \"I like to go there sometimes, that\\'s all.\" And so we took the subway to Nihonbashi. The place was practically\\nempty, maybe because it had been raining all morning. The smell of\\nrain filled the big, cavernous department store, and all the employees\\nhad that what-do-we-do-now? kind of look. Midori and I went to the\\nbasement restaurant and, after a close inspection of the plastic food in\\nthe window, both decided to have an old-fashioned cold lunch\\nassortment with rice and pickles and grilled fish and\\ntempura and teriyaki chicken. Inside, it was far from crowded despite\\nit being midday. \"God, how long has it been since I last had lunch in a department-\\nstore restaurant?\" I wondered aloud, drinking green tea from one of\\nthose slick, white cups you only get in a department-store restaurant. \"I like to do stuff like this,\" said Midori. \"I don\\'t know, it makes me\\nfeel like I\\'m doing something special. Probably reminds me of when I\\nwas a kid. My parents almost never took me to department stores.\" \"And I get the sneaking suspicion that\\'s all mine \\never\\n did. My mother\\nwas crazy about them.\" \"Lucky you!\" \"What are you talking about? I don\\'t particularly like going to\\ndepartment stores.\" \"No, I mean, you were lucky they cared enough about you to take you\\nplaces.\\'-\" \"Well, I was an only child,\" I said. \"When I was little I used to dream about going to a department-store\\nrestaurant all by myself when I grew up and eating anything I liked.\\nBut what an empty dream! What\\'s the fun of cramming your mouth\\nfull of rice all alone in a place like this? The food\\'s not all that great,\\nand it\\'s just big and crowded and stuffy and noisy. Still, every once in\\na while I think about coming here.\" \"I\\'ve been really lonely these past two months,\" I said. \"Yeah, I know. You told me in your letters,\" Midori said, her voice\\nflat. \"Anyway, let\\'s eat. That\\'s all I can think about now.\" We finished all the little fried and grilled and pickled items in the\\nseparate compartments of our fancy lacquered half-moon lunch boxes,\\ndrank our clear soup from lacquered bowls, and our green tea from\\nthose white cups. Midori followed lunch with a cigarette. When she\\nhad finished smoking, she stood up without a word and took her\\numbrella. I also stood up and took mine. \"Where do you want to go now?\" I asked. \"The roof, of course. That\\'s the next stop when you\\'ve had lunch in a\\ndepartment-store restaurant.\" There was no one on the roof in the rain, no clerk in the pet\\ndepartment, and the shutters were closed in the kiosks and the\\nchildren\\'s rides ticket booth. We opened our umbrellas and wandered\\namong the soaking wet wooden horses and garden chairs and stalls. It\\nseemed incredible to me that there could be anywhere so devoid of\\npeople in the middle of Tokyo. Midori said she wanted to look\\nthrough a telescope, so I put in a coin and held her umbrella over her\\nwhile she squinted through the eyepiece. In one corner of the roof there was a covered game area with a row of\\nchildren\\'s rides. Midori and I sat next to each other on some kind of\\nplatform and looked at the rain. \"So talk,\" Midori said. \"You\\'ve got something you want to say to me,\\nI know.\" \"I\\'m not trying to make excuses,\" I said, \"but I was really depressed\\nthat time. My brain was all fogged over. Nothing was registering with\\nme. But one thing became crystal clear to me when I couldn’t see you\\nany more. I realized that the only way I had been able to survive until\\nthen was having you in my life. When I lost you, the pain and\\nloneliness really got to me.\" \"Don\\'t you have any idea how painful and lonely it\\'s been for \\nme without \\nyou\\n these past two months?\" This took me completely off guard. \"No,\" I said. \"It never occurred to\\nme. I thought you were angry with me and didn\\'t want to see me.\" \"How can you be such an idiot? Of \\ncourse I\\n wanted to see \\nyou! I told\\nyou how much I like you! When I like somebody I really like them. It\\ndoesn\\'t turn on and off for me just like that. Don’t you realize at least\\nthat\\n much about me?\" \"Well, sure, but - \" \"That\\'s\\n why I was so mad at you! I wanted to give you a good kick up\\nthe arse. I mean, we hadn\\'t seen each other that whole time, and you\\nwere so spaced out thinking about this other girl you didn\\'t even \\nlook\\nat me! How could \\nI not\\n get angry at you? But apart from all that, I had\\nbeen feeling for a long time that it would be better for me if I kept\\naway from you for a while. To get things clear in my head.\" \"What kind of things?\" \"Our \\nrelationship,\\n of course. It was getting to the point where I\\nenjoyed being with \\nyou\\n far more than being with \\nhim, I\\n mean, don’t\\nyou think there\\'s something weird about that? And difficult? Of course\\nI still like him. He\\'s a little self-centred and narrow-minded and kind\\nof a fascist, but he\\'s got a lot of good points, and he\\'s the first man I\\never felt serious about. But you, well, you\\'re special to me. When I\\'m\\nwith you I feel something is just right. I believe in you. I like you. I\\ndon\\'t want to let you go. I was getting more and more confused, so I\\nwent to him and asked him what I should do. He told me to stop\\nseeing you. He said if I was going to see you, I should break up with\\nhim.\" \"So what did you do?\" \"I broke up with him. Just like that.\" Midori put a Marlboro in her\\nmouth, shielded it with her hand as she lit up, and inhaled. \"Why?\" \"\"Why?\\'!\" she screamed. \"Are you \\ncrazy?\\n You know the English\\nsubjunctive, you understand trigonometry, you can read Marx, and you don\\'t know the answer to something as simple as \\nthat?\\n Why do\\nyou even have to \\nask?\\n Why do you have to make a girl \\nsay\\n something\\nlike this? I like \\nyou\\n more than I like \\nhim,\\n that\\'s all. I wish I had fallen\\nin love with somebody a little more handsome, of course. But I didn\\'t.\\nI fell in love with you!\" I tried to speak, but I felt the words catching in my throat. Midori threw her cigarette into a puddle. \"Will you \\nplease\\n get that\\nlook off your face? You\\'re gonna make me cry. Don\\'t worry, \\nI know\\nyou\\'re in love with somebody else. I\\'m not expecting anything from\\nyou. But the least you can do is give me a hug. These have been two\\ntough months for me.\" I put up my umbrella, and we went behind the game area and held\\neach other close. Our bodies strained against each other, and our lips\\nmet. The smell of the rain clung to her hair and her jeans jacket. Girls\\'\\nbodies were so soft and warm! I could feel her breasts pressing against\\nmy chest through our clothing. How long had it been since my last\\nphysical contact with another human being? \"The day I last saw you, that night I talked to him, and we broke up,\"\\nMidori said. \"I love you,\" I said to her. \"From the bottom of my heart. I don\\'t ever\\nwant to let you go again. But there\\'s nothing I can do. I can\\'t make a\\nmove.\" \"Because of her?\" I nodded. \"Tell me, have you slept with her?\" \"Once. A year ago.\" \"And you haven\\'t seen her since then?\" \"I have\\n seen her: twice. But we didn’t do anything.\" \"Why not?\\nDoesn\\'t she love you?\" \"That\\'s hard to say,\" I said. \"It\\'s really complicated. And mixed up. And it\\'s been going on for such a long time, I don\\'t know what\\'s what any more. And neither does she. All I know is, I have a sort of responsibility in all this as a human being, and I can\\'t just turn\\nmy back on it. At least, that\\'s how I feel about it now. Even if she isn\\'t\\nin love with me.\" \"Let me just tell you this, Watanabe,\" said Midori, pressing her cheek\\nagainst my neck. \"I\\'m a real, live girl, with real, live blood gushing\\nthrough my veins. You\\'re holding me in your arms and I\\'m telling you\\nthat I love you. I\\'m ready to do anything you tell me to do. I may be a\\nlittle bit mad, but I\\'m a good girl, and honest, and I work hard. I\\'m\\nkind of cute, I have nice boobs. I\\'m a good cook, and my father left me\\na trust fund. I mean. I\\'m a real bargain, don\\'t you think? If you don\\'t\\ntake me. I\\'ll end up going somewhere else.\" \"I need time,\" I said. \"I need time to think and sort things out, and\\nmake some decisions. I\\'m sorry, but that\\'s all I can say at this point.\"\\n\"Yeah, but you \\ndo\\n love me from the bottom of your heart, right? And\\nyou never want to let me go again, right?\" \"I said it and I meant it.\" Midori pulled away from me with a smile on her face. \"OK, I’ll wait! I\\nbelieve in you,\" she said. \"But when you take me, you take \\nonly me.\\nAnd when you hold me in your arms, you think \\nonly\\n about \\nme. Is\\n that\\nclear?\" \"I understand exactly.\" \"I don’t care what you do to me, but I don’t want you to hurt me. I’ve\\nhad enough hurt already in my life. More than enough. Now I want to\\nbe happy.\" I drew her close and kissed her on the mouth. \"Drop the damn umbrella and wrap \\nboth\\n your arms around me - hard!\"\\nshe said. \"But we’ll get soaking wet!\" \"So what? I want you to stop thinking and hold me tight! I’ve been\\nwaiting two whole months for this!\" I set down the umbrella and held her close in the rain. The dull rush of\\ntyres on the highway enveloped us like a fog. The rain fell without a break, without a sound, soaking her hair and mine, running like tears\\ndown our cheeks, down to her denim jacket and my yellow nylon\\nwindcheater, spreading in dark stains. \"How about going back under the roof?\" I said. \"Come to my place. There\\'s nobody home now. We\\'ll both catch colds\\nlike this.\" \"It’s true.\" \"It\\'s as if we\\'ve just swum across a river,\" Midori said, smiling. \"What\\na great feeling!\" We bought a good-sized towel in the linen department and took turns\\ngoing into the bathroom to dry our hair. Then we took the subway,\\nwith the necessary top-up tickets, to her flat in Myogadani. She let me\\nshower first and then she showered. Lending me a bathrobe to wear\\nwhile my clothes dried, Midori changed into a polo shirt and skirt. We\\nsat at the kitchen table drinking coffee. \"Tell me about yourself,\" Midori said. \"What about me?\" \"Hmm, I don\\'t know, what do you hate?\" \"Chicken and VD and\\nbarbers who talk too much.\" \"What else?\" \"Lonely April nights and lacy telephone covers.\" \"What else?\" I shook my head. \"I can\\'t think of anything else.\" \"My boyfriend - which is to say, my ex-boyfriend - had all kinds of\\nthings he hated. Like when I wore too-short skirts, or when I smoked,\\nor how I got drunk too quickly, or said disgusting things, or criticized\\nhis friends. So if there\\'s anything about me you don\\'t like, just tell me,\\nand I\\'ll fix it if I can.\" \"I can\\'t think of anything,\" I said after giving it some thought. \"There\\'s\\nnothing.\" \"Really?\" \"I like everything you wear, and I like what you do and say and how\\nyou walk and how you get drunk. Everything.\" \"You mean I\\'m really OK just the way I am?\" \"I don\\'t know how you could change, so you must be fine the way you\\nare.\" \"How much do you love me?\" Midori asked. \"Enough to melt all the tigers in the world to butter,\" I said. \"Far out,\"\\nshe said with a hint of satisfaction. \"Will you hold me again?\" We got into her bed and held each other, kissing as the sound of the\\nrain filled our ears. Then we talked about everything from the\\nformation of the universe to our preferences in the hardness of boiled\\neggs. \"I wonder what ants do on rainy days?\" Midori asked. \"No idea,\" I said. \"They\\'re hard workers, so they probably spend the\\nday cleaning house or stock-taking.\" \"If they work so hard, why don’t they evolve? They\\'ve been the same\\nfor ever.\" \"I don\\'t know,\" I said. \"Maybe their body structure isn\\'t suited to\\nevolving - compared with monkeys, say.\" \"Hey, Watanabe, there\\'s a lot of stuff you don’t know. I thought you\\nknew everything.\" \"It\\'s a big world out there,\" I said. \"High mountains, deep oceans,\" Midori said. She put her hand inside\\nmy bathrobe and took hold of my erection. Then, with a gulp, she\\nsaid. \"Hey, Watanabe, joking aside, this isn’t gonna work. I could\\nnever get this big, hard thing inside me. No way.\" \"You\\'re kidding,\" I said with a sigh. \"Yup,\" she said, giggling. \"Don\\'t worry. It\\'ll be just fine. I\\'m sure it\\'ll\\nfit. Er, mind if I have a look?\" \"Feel free.\" Midori burrowed under the covers and groped me all over down there,\\nstretching the skin of my penis, weighing my testicles in the palm of\\nher hand. Then she poked her head out and sighed. \"I love it!\" she\\nsaid. \"No flattery intended! I really love it!\" \"Thank you,\" I said with simple gratitude. \"But really, Watanabe, you don\\'t want to do it with me, do you - until\\nyou get all that business straightened out?\" \"There\\'s no way I don\\'t want to do it with you,\" I said. \"I\\'m going\\ncrazy I want to do it so bad. But it just wouldn’t be right.\" \"You\\'re so damned stubborn! If I were you. I\\'d just do it - then think\\nabout it afterwards.\" \"You would?\" \"Only kidding,\" Midori said in a tiny voice. \"I probably wouldn\\'t do it,\\neither, if I were you. And that’s what I love about you. That’s what I\\nreally really love about you.\" \"How much do you love me?\" I asked, but she didn\\'t answer. Instead,\\nshe pressed against me, put her lips on my nipple and began to move\\nthe hand that was wrapped around my penis. The first thing that\\noccurred to me was how different it was to the way Naoko moved her\\nhand. Both were gentle and wonderful, but something was different\\nabout the way they did it, and so it felt like a totally different\\nexperience. \"Hey, Watanabe, I bet you\\'re thinking about that other girl.\" \"Not true,\" I lied. \"Really?\" \"Really.\" \"Because I would really hate that.\" \"I can\\'t think about anybody else,\" I said. \"Want to touch my breasts, or down there?\" Midori asked. \"Oh wow.\\nI\\'d love to, but I’d better not. If we do all those\\nthings at once, it\\'ll be too much for me.\" Midori nodded and rustled around under the covers, pulling her panties off and holding them against the tip of my penis. \"You can come on these,\" she said. \"But it\\'ll make a mess of them.\" \"Stop it, will you? You\\'re gonna make me cry,\" said Midori, a if on\\nthe verge of tears. \"All I have to do is wash them. So don\\'t hold back,\\njust let yourself come all you want. If you\\'re worried about my panties, buy me a new pair. Or are they going to keep you from\\ncoming because they\\'re mine?\" \"No way,\" I said. \"Go on then, let go.\" When I was through, Midori inspected my semen. \"Wow, that\\'s a huge\\namount!\" \"Too much?\" \"Nah, it\\'s OK, silly. Come all you want,\" she said with a smile. Then\\nshe kissed me. In the evening, Midori did some shopping in the neighbourhood and\\nmade dinner. We ate tempura and rice with green peas at the kitchen\\ntable, and washed it all down with beer. \"Eat a lot and make lots of semen,\" Midori said. \"Then I\\'ll be nice and\\nhelp you get rid of it.\" \"Thanks very much,\" I said. \"I know all sorts of ways to do it. I learned from the women\\'s\\nmagazines when we had the bookshop. Once they had this special\\nedition all about how to take care of your husband so he won\\'t cheat\\non you while you\\'re pregnant and can\\'t have sex. There\\'s tons of ways.\\nWanna try \\'em?\" \"I can hardly wait,\" I said. After saying goodbye to Midori, I bought a newspaper at the station,\\nbut when I opened it on the train, I realized I had absolutely no desire\\nto read a paper and in fact couldn\\'t understand what it said. All I could\\ndo was glare at the incomprehensible page of print and wonder what\\nwas going to happen to me from now on, and how the things around\\nme would be changing. I felt as if the world was pulsating every now\\nand then. I sighed deeply and closed my eyes. As regards what I had\\ndone that day, I felt not the slightest regret; I knew for certain that if I\\nhad to do it all over again, I would live this day in exactly the same\\nway. I would hold Midori tight on the roof in the rain; I would get\\nsoaking wet with her; and I would let her fingers bring me to climax in her bed. I had no doubts about those things. I loved Midori, and I was\\nhappy that she had come back to me. The two of us could make it, that\\nwas certain. As Midori herself had said, she was a real, live girl with\\nblood in her veins, and she was putting her warm body in my arms. It\\nhad been all I could do to suppress the intense desire I had to strip her\\nnaked, throw open her body, and sink myself in her warmth. There\\nwas no way I could have made myself stop her once she was holding\\nmy penis and moving her hand. I wanted her to do it, she wanted to do\\nit, and we were in love. Who could have stopped such a thing? It was\\ntrue: I loved Midori. And I had probably known as much for a while. I\\nhad just been avoiding the conclusion for a very long time. The problem was that I could never explain these developments to\\nNaoko. It would have been hard enough at any point, but with Naoko\\nin her present condition, there was no way I could tell her I had fallen\\nin love with another girl. And besides, I still loved Naoko. As twisted\\nas that love might be, I did love her. Somewhere inside me there was\\nstill preserved a broad, open space, untouched, for Naoko and no one\\nelse. One thing I could do was write a letter to Reiko that confessed\\neverything with total honesty. At home, I sat on the veranda, watching\\nthe rain pour down on the garden at night, and assembling phrases in\\nmy head. Then I went to my desk and wrote the letter. \\nIt is almost\\nunbearable to me that I now have to write a letter like this to you,\\n I\\nbegan. I summarized my relationship with Midori and explained what\\nhad happened that day. I have always loved Naoko, and I still love her. But there is a decisive\\nfinality to what exists between Midori and me. It has an irresistible\\npower that is bound to sweep me into the future. What I feel for\\nNaoko is a tremendously quiet and gentle and transparent love, but\\nwhat I feel for Midori is a wholly different emotion. It stands and\\nwalks on its own, living and breathing and throbbing and shaking me to the roots of my being. I don\\'t know what to do. I\\'m confused. I\\'m\\nnot trying to make excuses for myself, but I do believe that I have\\nlived as sincerely as I know how. I have never lied to anyone, and I\\nhave taken care over the years not to hurt other people. And yet I find\\nmyself tossed into this labyrinth. How can this be? I can\\'t explain it. I\\ndon\\'t know what I should do. Can you tell me, Reiko? You\\'re the only\\none I can turn to for advice. I posted the letter that night by special delivery. Reiko\\'s answer came five days later, dated 17 June. Let me start with the good news. Naoko has been improving far more\\nrapidly than anyone could have expected. I talked to her once on the\\nphone, and she spoke with real lucidity. She may even be able to come\\nback here before long. Now, about you. I think you take everything too seriously. Loving another person is a\\nwonderful thing, and if that love is sincere, no one ends up tossed into\\na labyrinth. You have to have more faith in yourself. My advice to you is very simple. First of all, if you are drawn so\\nstrongly to this Midori person, it is only natural for you to have fallen\\nin love with her. It might go well, or it might not. But love is like that.\\nWhen you fall in love, the natural thing to do is give yourself to it.\\nThat\\'s what I think. It\\'s just a form of sincerity. Second, as to whether or not you should have sex with Midori, that is\\nfor you to work out. I can\\'t say a thing. Talk it over with Midori and\\nreach your own conclusion, one that makes sense to you. Third, don\\'t tell any of this to Naoko. If things should develop to the\\npoint where you absolutely have to tell her, then you and I will come\\nup with a good plan together. So now, just keep it quiet. Leave it to\\nme. The fourth thing I have to say is that you have been such a great\\nsource of strength for Naoko that even if you no longer have the\\nfeelings of a lover towards her, there is still a lot you can do for her.\\nSo don\\'t brood over everything in that super-serious way of yours. All\\nof us (by which I mean all of us, both normal and not-so-normal) are\\nimperfect human beings living in an imperfect world. We don\\'t live\\nwith the mechanical precision of a bank account or by measuring all\\nour lines and angles with rulers and protractors. Am I right? My own personal feeling is that Midori sounds like a great girl. I\\nunderstand just reading your letter why you would be drawn to her.\\nAnd I understand, too, why you would also be drawn to Naoko.\\nThere\\'s nothing the least bit sinful about it. Things like that happen all\\nthe time in this great big world of ours. It\\'s like taking a boat out on a\\nbeautiful lake on a beautiful day and thinking both the sky and the\\nlake are beautiful. So stop eating yourself up. Things will go where\\nthey\\'re supposed to go if you just let them take their natural course.\\nDespite your best efforts, people are going to be hurt when it\\'s time for\\nthem to be hurt. Life is like that. I know I sound like I\\'m preaching\\nfrom a pulpit, but it\\'s about time you learned to live like this. You try\\ntoo hard to make life fit your way of doing things. If you don’t want to\\nspend time in an insane asylum, you have to open up a little more and\\nlet yourself go with life\\'s natural flow. I\\'m just a powerless and\\nimperfect woman, but still there are times when I think to myself how\\nwonderful life can be! Believe me, it\\'s true! So stop what you\\'re doing\\nthis minute and get happy. \\nWork\\n at making yourself happy! Needless to say, I do feel sorry that you and Naoko could not see\\nthings through to a happy ending. But who can say what\\'s best? That\\'s\\nwhy you need to grab whatever chance you have of happiness where\\nyou find it, and not worry about other people too much. My\\nexperience tells me that we get no more than two or three such\\nchances in a lifetime, and if we let them go, we regret it for the rest of\\nour lives. I\\'m playing the guitar every day for no one in particular. It seems a bit\\npointless. I don\\'t like dark, rainy nights, either. I hope I\\'ll have another\\nchance to play my guitar and eat grapes with you and Naoko in the\\nroom with me. Ah, well, until then -\\nReiko Ishida Reiko wrote to me several times after Naoko\\'s death. It wasn\\'t my\\nfault, she said. It was nobody\\'s fault, any more than you could blame\\nsomeone for the rain. But I never answered her. What could I have\\nsaid? What good would it have done? Naoko no longer existed in this\\nworld; she had become a handful of ashes. They held a quiet funeral for Naoko in Kobe at the end of August, and\\nwhen it was over, I went back to Tokyo. I told my landlord I would be\\naway for a while and my boss at the Italian restaurant that I wouldn\\'t\\nbe coming in to work. To Midori I wrote a short note: I couldn’t say\\nanything just yet, but I hoped she would wait for me a little longer. I\\nspent the next three days in cinemas, and after I had seen every new\\nfilm in Tokyo, I packed my rucksack, took out all my savings from the\\nbank, went to Shinjuku Station, and got the first express train I could\\nfind going out of town. Where I went on my travels, it’s impossible for me to recall. I\\nremember the sights and sounds and smells clearly enough, but the\\nnames of the towns are gone, as well as any sense of the order in\\nwhich I travelled from place to place. I would move from town to\\ntown by train or bus or hitching a lift in a lorry, spreading out my\\nsleeping bag in empty car parks or stations or parks or on river banks\\nor the seashore. I once persuaded them to let me sleep in the corner of\\na local police station, and another time slept alongside a graveyard. I\\ndidn\\'t care where I slept, provided I was out of people\\'s way and could\\nstay in my sleeping bag as long as I felt like it. Exhausted from\\nwalking, I would crawl into it, gulp down some cheap whisky, and fall fast asleep. In nice towns, people would bring me food and mosquito\\ncoils, and in not-so-nice towns, people would call the police and have\\nme chased out of the parks. It made no difference to me one way or\\nanother. All I wanted was to put myself to sleep in towns I didn’t\\nknow. When I ran low on money, I would work as a labourer for a few days\\nuntil I had what I needed. There was always work for me to do. I just\\nkept moving from one town to the next, no destination in mind. The\\nworld was big and full of weird things and strange people. One time I\\ncalled Midori because I had to hear her voice. \"Term started a long time ago, yju know,\" she said. \"Some courses\\nare even asking for papers already. What are you going to do? Do you\\nrealize you\\'ve been out of touch for three whole weeks now? Where\\nare you? What are you doing?\" \"Sorry, but I can\\'t go back to Tokyo yet. Not yet.\" \"And that\\'s all you\\'re going to tell me?\" \"There\\'s really nothing more I can say at this point. Maybe in October. it Midori hung up without a word. I went on with my travels. Every now and then I\\'d stay at a dosshouse\\nand have a bath and shave. What I saw in the mirror looked terrible.\\nThe sun had dried out my skin, my eyes were sunken, and odd stains\\nand cuts marked my cheekbones. I looked as if I had just crawled out\\nof a cave somewhere, but it was me after all. It was me. By that time, I was moving down the coast, as far from Tokyo as I\\ncould get - maybe in Tottori or the hidden side of Hyogo. Walking\\nalong the seashore was easy. I could always find a comfortable place\\nto sleep in the sand. I\\'d make a fire from driftwood and roast some\\ndried fish I bought from a local fisherman. Then I’d swallow some\\nwhisky and listen to the waves while I thought about Naoko. It was\\ntoo strange to think that she was dead and no longer part of this world.\\nI couldn\\'t absorb the truth of it. I couldn\\'t believe it. I had heard the nails being driven into the lid of her coffin, but I still couldn\\'t adjust to\\nthe fact that she had returned to nothingness. No, the image of her was still too vivid in my memory. I could still\\nsee her enclosing my penis in her mouth, her hair falling across my\\nbelly. I could still feel her warmth, her breath against me, and that\\nhelpless moment when I could do nothing but come. I could bring all\\nthis back as clearly as if it had happened only five minutes ago, and I\\nfelt sure that Naoko was still beside me, that I could just reach out and\\ntouch her. But no, she wasn\\'t there; her flesh no longer existed in this\\nworld. Nights when it was impossible for me to sleep, images of Naoko\\nwould come back to me. There was no way I could stop them. Too\\nmany memories of her were crammed inside me, and as soon as one of\\nthem found the slightest opening, the rest would force their way out in\\nan endless stream, an unstoppable flood: Naoko in her yellow raincape\\ncleaning the aviary and carrying the feed bag that rainy morning; the\\ncaved-in birthday cake and the feel of Naoko\\'s tears soaking through\\nmy shirt (yes, it had been raining then, too); Naoko walking beside me\\nin winter wearing her camel-hair coat; Naoko touching the hairslide\\nshe always wore; Naoko peering at me with those incredibly clear\\neyes of hers; Naoko sitting on the sofa, legs drawn up beneath her blue\\nnightdress, chin resting on her knees. The memories would slam against me like the waves of an incoming\\ntide, sweeping my body along to some strange new place - a place\\nwhere I lived with the dead. There Naoko lived, and I could speak\\nwith her and hold her in my arms. Death in that place was not a\\ndecisive element that brought life to an end. There, death was but one\\nof many elements comprising life. There Naoko lived with death\\ninside her. And to me she said, \"Don\\'t worry, it\\'s only death. Don’t let\\nit bother you.\" I felt no sadness in that strange place. Death was death, and Naoko\\nwas Naoko. \"What\\'s the problem?\" she asked me with a bashful smile. \"I\\'m here, aren\\'t I?\" Her familiar little gestures soothed my heart like a\\nhealing balm. \"If this is death,\" I thought to myself, \"then death is not\\nso bad.\" \"It\\'s true,\" said Naoko, \"death is nothing much. It\\'s just death.\\nThings are so easy for me here.\" Naoko spoke to me in the spaces\\nbetween the crashing of the dark waves. Eventually, though, the tide would pull back, and I would be left on\\nthe beach alone. Powerless, I could go nowhere; sadness itself would\\nenvelop me in deep darkness until the tears came. I felt less that I was\\ncrying than that the tears were simply oozing out of me like\\nperspiration. I had learned one thing from Kizuki\\'s death, and I believed that I had\\nmade it a part of myself in the form of a philosophy: \"Death exists, not\\nas the opposite but as a part of life.\" By living our lives, we nurture death. True as this might be, it was\\nonly one of the truths we had to leam. What I learned from Naoko\\'s\\ndeath was this: no truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a\\nloved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure\\nthat sorrow. All we can do is see that sadness through to the end and\\nleam something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing\\nthe next sadness that comes to us without warning. Hearing the waves\\nat night, listening to the sound of the wind, day after day I focused on\\nthese thoughts of mine. Knapsack on my back, sand in my hair, I\\nmoved farther and farther west, surviving on a diet of whisky, bread\\nand water. One windy evening, as I lay wrapped in my sleeping bag, weeping, by\\nthe side of an abandoned hulk, a young fisherman passed by and\\noffered me a cigarette. I accepted it and had my first smoke in over a\\nyear. He asked why I was crying, and almost by reflex I told him that\\nmy mother had died. I couldn’t take the sadness, I said, and so I was\\non the road. He expressed his deep sympathy and brought a big bottle\\nof sake and two glasses from his house. The wind tore along the sand beach as we sat there drinking. He told\\nme that he had lost his mother when he was 16. Never healthy, she\\nhad worn herself out working from morning to night. I half-listened to\\nhim, sipping my sake and grunting in response every now and then. I\\nfelt as if I were hearing a story from some far-off world. What the hell\\nwas he talking about? I wondered, and all of a sudden I was filled with\\nintense rage: I wanted to strangle him. Who gives a shit about your\\nmother? I\\'ve lost Naoko! Her beautiful flesh has vanished from this\\nworld! Why the hell are you telling me about your fucking mother?! But my rage disappeared as quickly as it had flared up. I closed my\\neyes and went on half-listening to the fisherman\\'s endless talk.\\nEventually he asked me if I had eaten. No, I said, but in my rucksack I\\nhad bread and cheese, a tomato and a piece of chocolate. What had I\\neaten for lunch ? he asked. Bread and cheese, tomato and chocolate, I answered. \"Wait here,\" he\\nsaid and ran off. I tried to stop him, but he disappeared into the\\ndarkness without looking back. All I could do was go on drinking my sake. The shore was littered\\nwith paper flecks from fireworks that had been exploded on the sand,\\nand waves crashed against the beach with a mad roar. A scrawny dog\\ncame up wagging its tail and sniffing around my little campfire for\\nsomething to eat but eventually gave up and wandered away. The young fisherman came back half an hour later with two boxes of\\nsushi and a new bottle of sake. I should eat the top box straight away\\nbecause that had fish in it, he said, but the bottom box had only nori\\nrolls and deep-fried tofu skins so they would last all tomorrow. He\\nfilled both our glasses with sake from the new bottle. I thanked him\\nand polished off the whole top box myself, though it had more than\\nenough for two. After we had drunk as much sake as we could\\nmanage, he offered to put me up for the night, but when I said I would\\nrather sleep alone on the beach, he left it at that. As he stood to go, he\\ntook a folded ? 5,000 note from his pocket and shoved it into the pocket of my shirt. \"Here,\" he said, \"get yourself some healthy food.\\nYou look awful.\" I said he had done more than enough for me and that\\nI couldn’t accept money on top of everything else, but he refused to\\ntake it back. \"It\\'s not money,\" he said, \"it\\'s my feelings. Don’t think\\nabout it too much, just take it.\" All I could do was thank him and\\naccept it. When he had gone, I suddenly thought about my old girlfriend, the\\none I had first slept with in my last year of school. Chills ran through\\nme as I realized how badly I had treated her. I had hardly ever thought\\nabout \\nher\\n thoughts or feelings or the pain I had caused her. She was\\nsuch a sweet and gentle thing, but at the time I had taken her\\nsweetness for granted and later hardly gave her a second thought.\\nWhat was she doing now? I wondered. And had she forgiven me? A wave of nausea came over me, and I vomited by the old ship. My\\nhead hurt from too much sake, and I felt bad about having lied to the\\nfisherman and taken his money. It was time for me to go back to\\nTokyo, I decided; I couldn’t keep this up for ever. I stuffed my\\nsleeping bag into my rucksack, slipped my amis through the straps\\nand walked to the local railway station. I told the man at the ticket-\\noffice window that I wanted to get to Tokyo as soon as possible. He\\nchecked his timetable and said I could make it as far as Osaka by\\nmorning if I transferred from one night train to another, then I could\\ntake the bullet train from there. I thanked him and used the x\"5,000\\nnote the fisherman gave me to buy a ticket to Tokyo. Waiting for the\\ntrain, I bought a newspaper and checked the date: 2 October, 1970. So\\nI had been travelling for a full month. I knew I had to go back to the\\nreal world. The month of travelling neither lifted my spirits nor softened the blow\\nof Naoko\\'s death. I arrived back in Tokyo in pretty much the same\\nstate in which I had left. I couldn\\'t even bring myself to phone Midori.\\nWhat could I say to her? How could I begin? \"It’s all over now; you\\nand I can be happy together\"? No, that was out of the question. However I might phrase it, though, the facts were the same: Naoko\\nwas dead, and Midori was still here. Naoko was a mound of white ash,\\nand Midori was a living, breathing human being. I was overcome with a sense of my own defilement. Though I\\nreturned to Tokyo I did nothing for days but shut myself up in my\\nroom. My memory remained fixed on the dead rather than the living.\\nThe rooms I had set aside in there for Naoko were shuttered, the\\nfurniture draped in white, the windowsills dusty. I spent the better part\\nof each day in those rooms. And I thought about Kizuki. \"So you\\nfinally made Naoko yours,\" I heard myself telling him. \"Oh, well, she\\nwas yours to begin with. Now, maybe, she\\'s where she belongs. But in\\nthis world, in this imperfect world of the living, I did the best I could\\nfor Naoko. I tried to establish a new life for the two of us. But forget\\nit, Kizuki. I\\'m giving her to you. You\\'re the one she chose, after all. In\\nwoods as dark as the depths of her own heart, she hanged herself.\\nOnce upon a time, you dragged a part of me into the world of the\\ndead, and now Naoko has dragged another part of me into that world.\\nSometimes I feel like the caretaker of a museum - a huge, empty\\nmuseum where no one ever comes, and I\\'m watching over it for no\\none but myself.\" The fourth day after my return to Tokyo, a letter came from Reiko.\\nSpecial delivery. It was a simple note: \\nI haven\\'t been able\\nto get in touch with you for weeks, and I\\'m worried. Please call me. At\\n9 a.m. and 9 p.m. I will be waiting by the telephone. I called her at nine o\\'clock that night. Reiko picked up after one ring.\\n\"Are you OK?\" she asked. \"More or less,\" I said. \"Do you mind if I come and visit you the day after tomorrow?\" \"Visit me? You mean here in Tokyo?\" \"That\\'s exactly what I mean. I want to have a good, long talk with\\nyou.\" \"You\\'re leaving the sanatorium?\" \"It\\'s the only way I can come and see you, isn’t it? Anyway, it\\'s about\\ntime for me to get out of this place. I\\'ve been here eight years, after all.\\nIf they keep me any longer. I\\'ll start to rot.\" I found it difficult to speak. After a short silence. Reiko went on: \"I\\'ll\\nbe on the 3.20 bullet train the day after tomorrow. Will you meet me\\nat the station? Do you still remember what I look like? Or have you\\nlost interest in me now that Naoko\\'s dead?\" \"No way,\" I said. \"See you at Tokyo Station the day after tomorrow at\\n3.20.\" \"You won\\'t have any trouble recognizing me. I\\'m the old lady with the\\nguitar case. There aren\\'t many of those.\" And in fact, I had no trouble finding Reiko in the crowd. She wore a\\nman\\'s tweed jacket, white trousers, and red trainers. Her hair was as\\nshort as ever, with the usual clumps sticking up. In her right hand she\\nheld a brown leather suitcase, and in her left a black guitar case. She\\ngave me a big, wrinkly smile the moment she spotted me, and I found\\nmyself grinning back. I took her suitcase and walked beside her to the\\ntrain for the western suburbs. \"Hey, Watanabe, how long have you been wearing that awful face? Or\\nis that the \\'in\\' look in Tokyo these days?\" \"I was travelling for a while, ate junk all the time,\" I said. \"How did\\nyou find the bullet train?\" \"Awful!\" she said. \"You can\\'t open the windows. I wanted to buy a\\nbox lunch from one of the station buffets.\" \"They sell them on board, you know.\" \"Yeah, overpriced plastic sandwiches. A starving horse wouldn’t touch\\nthat stuff. I always used to enjoy the boxed lunches at Gotenba\\nStation.\" \"Once upon a time, before the bullet train.\" \"Well, \\nI\\'m\\n from once upon a time before the bullet train!\" On the train out to Kichijoji. Reiko watched the Musashino landscape\\npassing the window with all the curiosity of a tourist. \"Has it changed much in eight years?\" I asked. \"You don\\'t know what I\\'m feeling now, do you, Watanabe?\" \"No, I\\ndon\\'t.\" \"I\\'m scared,\" she said. \"So scared, I could go crazy just like that. I\\ndon\\'t know what I\\'m supposed to do, flung out here all by myself.\"\\nShe paused. \"But \\'Go crazy just like that.\\' Kind of a cool expression,\\ndon’t you think?\" I smiled and took her hand. \"Don\\'t worry,\" I said. \"You\\'ll be OK. Your\\nown strength got you this far.\" \"It wasn\\'t my own strength that got me out of that place,\" Reiko said.\\n\"It was Naoko and you. I couldn’t stand it there without Naoko, and I\\nhad to come to Tokyo to talk to you. That\\'s all. If nothing had\\nhappened I probably would have spent the rest of my life there.\" I nodded. \"What are you planning to do from now on?\" I asked Reiko. \"I\\'m going to Asahikawa,\" she said. \"Way up in the wilds of\\nHokkaido! An old college friend of mine runs a music school there,\\nand she\\'s been asking me for two or three years now to help her out. I\\ntold her it was too cold for me. I mean, \\nI finally\\n get my freedom back\\nand I\\'m supposed to go to Asahikawa? It\\'s hard to get excited about a\\nplace like that - some hole in the ground.\" \"It\\'s not so awful,\" I said, laughing. \"I\\'ve been there. It\\'s not a bad little\\ntown. Got its own special atmosphere.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely. It\\'s much better than staying in Tokyo.\" \"Oh, well,\" she said. \"I don’t have anywhere else to go, and I\\'ve\\nalready sent my stuff there. Hey, Watanabe, promise me you\\'ll come\\nand visit me in Asahikawa.\" \"Of course I will. But do you have to leave straight away? Can\\'t you stay in Tokyo for a while?\" \"I’d like to hang around here a few days if I can. Can you put me up? I won\\'t get in your way.\" \"No problem,\" I said. \"I have a big closet I can sleep in, in\\nmy sleeping bag.\" \"I can\\'t do that to you.\" \"No, really. It\\'s a \\nhuge\\n closet.\" Reiko tapped out a rhythm on the guitar case between her legs. \"I\\'m\\nprobably going to have to condition myself a little before I go to\\nAsahikawa. I\\'m just not used to being in the outside world. There\\'s a\\nlot of stuff I don’t get, and I\\'m nervous. Think you can help me out a\\nlittle? You\\'re the only one I can ask.\" \"I\\'ll do anything I can to help you,\" I said. \"I hope I\\'m not getting in your way,\" she said. \"I don’t have any way\\nfor you to get in,\" I said. She looked at me and turned up the corners of her mouth in a smile\\nbut said nothing. We hardly talked the rest of the way to Kichijoji Station or on the bus\\nback to my place. We traded a few random comments on the changes\\nin Tokyo and Reiko\\'s time at the College of Music and my one trip to\\nAsahikawa, but said nothing about Naoko. Ten months had gone by\\nsince I last saw Reiko, but walking by her side I felt strangely calmed\\nand comforted. This was a familiar feeling, I thought, and then it\\noccurred to me it was the way I used to feel when walking the streets\\nof Tokyo with Naoko. And just as Naoko and I had shared the dead\\nKizuki, Reiko and I shared the dead Naoko. This thought made it\\nimpossible for me to go on talking. Reiko continued speaking for a\\nwhile, but when she realized that I wasn\\'t saying anything, she also\\nfell silent. Neither of us said a word on the bus. It was one of those early autumn afternoons when the light is sharp\\nand clear, exactly as it had been a year earlier when I visited Naoko in\\nKyoto. The clouds were white and as narrow as bones, the sky wide\\nopen and high. The fragrance of the breeze, the tone of the light, the tiny flowers in the grass, the subtle reverberations that accompanied\\nsounds: all these told me that autumn had come again, increasing the\\ndistance between me and the dead with each cycle of the seasons.\\nKizuki was still 17 and Naoko 21: for ever. \"Oh, what a relief to come to a place like this!\" Reiko said, looking all\\naround as we stepped off the bus. \"Because there\\'s nothing here,\" I said. As I led her through the back gate through the garden to my cottage,\\nReiko was impressed by everything she saw. \"This is terrific!\" she said. \"You \\nmade\\n these shelves and the desk?\"\\n\"Yep,\" I said, pouring tea. \"You\\'re obviously good with your hands. And you keep the place so\\nclean!\" \"Storm Trooper\\'s influence,\" I said. \"He turned me into a cleanliness\\nfreak. Not that my landlord\\'s complaining.\" \"Oh, your landlord! I ought to introduce myself to him. That\\'s his place on the other side of the garden, I suppose.\" \"Introduce\\nyourself to him? What for?\" \"What do you mean \"what for\\'? Some weird old lady shows up in your\\nplace and starts playing the guitar, he\\'s going to wonder what\\'s going\\non. Better to start out on the right foot. I even brought a box of tea\\nsweets for him.\" \"Very clever,\" I said. \"The wisdom that comes with age. I\\'m going to tell him I\\'m your aunt\\non your mother\\'s side, visiting from Kyoto, so don\\'t contradict me.\\nThe age difference comes in handy at times like this. Nobody\\'s going\\nto get suspicious.\" Reiko took the box of sweets from her bag and went off to pay her\\nrespects. I sat on the veranda, drinking another cup of tea and playing\\nwith the cat. Twenty minutes went by, and when Reiko finally came\\nback, she pulled a tin of rice crackers from her bag and said it was a\\npresent for me. \"What were you talking about for so long?\" I asked, munching on a\\ncracker. \"You,\\n of course,\" said Reiko, cradling the cat and nibbing her cheek\\nagainst it. \"He says you\\'re a very proper young man, a serious\\nstudent.\" \"Are you sme he was talking about me?\" \"There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that he was talking about\\nyou,\" she said with a laugh. Then, noticing my guitar, she picked it up,\\nadjusted the tuning, and played Antonio Carlos Jobim\\'s \"Desafinado\".\\nIt had been months since I last heard Reiko\\'s guitar, and it gave me\\nthat old, warm feeling. \"You practising the guitar?\" she asked. \"It was kicking around the landlord\\'s storehouse, so I borrowed it and\\nI plunk on it once in a while. That\\'s all.\" \"I\\'ll give you a lesson later. Absolutely free.\" Reiko put down the\\nguitar and took off her tweed jacket. Sitting against the veranda post,\\nshe smoked a cigarette. She was wearing a madras check short-sleeve\\nshirt. \"Nice shirt, don\\'t you think?\" she asked. \"It is,\" I said. In fact it \\nwas\\n a good-looking shirt with a handsome\\npattern. \"It\\'s Naoko\\'s,\" said Reiko. \"I bet you didn’t know we were the same\\nsize. Especially when she first came to the sanatorium. She put on a\\nlittle weight after that, but still we were pretty much the same size:\\nblouses, trousers, shoes, hats. Bras were about the only thing we\\ncouldn’t share. I\\'ve got practically nothing here. So we were always\\nswapping clothes. Actually, it was more like joint ownership.\" Now that she mentioned it, I saw that Reiko\\'s build was almost\\nidentical to Naoko\\'s. Because of the shape of her face and her thin\\narms and legs, she had always given me the impression of being\\nsmaller and slimmer than Naoko, but in fact she was surprisingly\\nsolid. \"The jacket and trousers are hers, too,\" said Reiko. \"It\\'s all hers. Does\\nit bother you to see me wearing her stuff?\" \"Not at all,\" I said. \"I\\'m sure Naoko would be glad to have somebody\\nwearing her clothes - especially you.\" \"It\\'s strange,\" Reiko said with a little snap of the fingers. \"Naoko\\ndidn\\'t leave a will or anything - except where her clothes were\\nconcerned. She scribbled one line on a memo pad on her desk. \"Please\\ngive all my clothes to Reiko.’ She was a funny one, don’t you think?\\nWhy would she be concerned about her clothes of all things when\\nshe\\'s getting ready to die? Who gives a damn about clothes? She must\\nhave had tons of other things she wanted to say.\" \"Maybe not,\" I said. Puffing on her cigarette, Reiko seemed lost in thought. Then she said,\\n\"You want to hear the whole story, in order, I suppose.\" \"I do,\" I said. \"Please tell me everything.\" \"Tests at the hospital in Osaka showed that Naoko\\'s condition was\\nimproving for the moment but that she should stay there on a\\nsomewhat longer-term basis so that they could continue the intensive therapy for its future benefits. I told you that\\nmuch in my letter - the one I sent you somewhere around the tenth of\\nAugust.\" \"Right. I read that letter.\" \"Well, on the 24th of August I got a call from Naoko\\'s mother asking\\nif it was OK for Naoko to visit me at the sanatorium. Naoko wanted to\\npack the things she had left with me and, because she wouldn\\'t be able\\nto see me for a while, she wanted to have a nice long talk with me, and\\nperhaps spend a night in our flat. I said that would be fine. I wanted to\\nsee \\nher\\n really badly and to have a talk with her. So Naoko and her\\nmother arrived the next day, the 25th, in a taxi. The three of us worked\\ntogether, packing Naoko\\'s things and chatting away. Late in the\\nafternoon, Naoko said it would be OK for her mother to go home, that she’d be fine, so they called a taxi and the mother left. We weren\\'t\\nworried at all because Naoko seemed to be in such good spirits. In\\nfact, until then I had been \\nvery\\n worried. I had been expecting her to be\\ndepressed and worn out and emaciated. I mean, I knew how much the\\ntesting and therapy and stuff they do at those hospitals can take it out\\nof you, so I had some real doubts about this visit. But one look at her\\nwas all it took to convince me she\\'d be OK. She looked a lot healthier\\nthan I had expected and she was smiling and joking and talking much\\nmore normally than when I had seen her last. She had been to the\\nhairdresser\\'s and was showing off her new hairdo. So I thought there\\nwould be nothing to worry about even if her mother left us alone.\\nNaoko told me that \\nthis\\n time she was going to let those hospital\\ndoctors cure her once and for all, and I said that that would probably\\nbe the best thing to do. So then the two of us went out for a walk,\\ntalking all the time, mainly about the future. Naoko told me that what\\nshe’d really like was for the two of us to get out of the sanatorium and\\nlive together somewhere.\" \"Live together? You and Naoko?\" \"That\\'s right,\" said Reiko with a little shrug. \"So I told her it sounded\\ngood to me, but what about Watanabe? And she said, \"Don\\'t worry.\\nI\\'ll get everything straight with him.\\' That\\'s all. Then she talked about\\nwhere she and I would live and what we\\'d do, that kind of thing. After\\nthat we went to the aviary and played with the birds.\" I took a beer from the fridge and opened it. Reiko lit another cigarette,\\nthe cat sound asleep in her lap. \"That girl had everything worked out for herself. I\\'m sure that\\'s why\\nshe was so full of energy and smiling and healthylooking. It must have\\nbeen such a load off her mind to feel she knew exactly what she was\\ngoing to do. So then we finished going through her stuff and throwing\\nwhat she didn\\'t need into the metal drum in the garden and burning it:\\nthe notebook she had used as a diary, and all the letters she had\\nreceived. Your letters, too. This seemed a bit strange to me, so I asked her why she was burning stuff like that. I mean, she had always been\\nso careful about putting your letters away in a safe place and reading\\nthem over and over. She said, \"I\\'m getting rid of everything from the\\npast so I can be reborn in the future.\\' I suppose I pretty much took her\\nat her word. It had its own kind of logic to it, sort of. I remember\\nthinking how much I wanted her to get healthy and happy. She was so\\nsweet and lovely that day: I wish you could have seen her! \"When that was over, we went to the dining hall for supper the way\\nwe used to. Then we bathed and I opened a bottle of good wine that I\\nhad been keeping for a special occasion like this and we drank and I\\nplayed the guitar. The Beatles, as always, \"Norwegian Wood\",\\n\"Michelle\", her favourites. Both of us were feeling pretty good. We\\nturned out the lights, got undressed and lay in our beds. It was one of\\nthose steaming hot nights. We had the windows wide open, but there\\nwas hardly a breath of wind. It was black as ink outside, the\\ngrasshoppers were screaming, and the smell of the summer grass was\\nso thick in the room it was hard to breathe. All of a sudden, Naoko\\nstarted talking about you - about the night she had sex with you. In\\nincredible detail. How you took her clothes off, how you touched her,\\nhow she found herself getting wet, how you went inside her, how\\nwonderful it felt: she told me all of this in vivid detail. So I asked her:\\nwhy are you telling me this now, all of a sudden? I mean, up to then,\\nshe had never spoken openly to me about sex. Of course, we had had\\nsome frank sexual talk as a kind of therapy, but she had been too\\nembarrassed to go into details. Now I couldn\\'t stop her. I was shocked.\\n\"So she says, \"I don’t know, I just feel like talking about it. I\\'ll stop if\\nyou’d rather not hear it.\\' \"No,\\' I said, that\\'s OK. \"If there\\'s something\\nyou need to talk about, you\\'d better get it all out. I\\'ll listen to anything\\nyou have to say.\\' \"So she went on with her story: \"When he went inside me, I couldn\\'t\\nbelieve how much it hurt. It was my first time, after all. I was so wet,\\nhe slipped right in, but still, my brain fogged over - it hurt so much. He put it in as far as he could. I thought, but then he lifted my legs and\\nwent in even farther. That sent chills all through my body, as if I was\\nsoaking in ice water. My arms and legs went numb, and a wave of\\ncold went through me. I didn’t know what was happening. I thought I\\nmight die right there and then, and I didn\\'t care one way or another.\\nBut he realized I was in pain, so he stopped moving, and still deep\\ninside me, he started kissing me all over - my hair, my neck, my\\nbreasts - for a long, long time. Little by little, the warmth returned to\\nmy body, and then, very slowly, he started to move. Oh, Reiko, it was\\nso wonderful! Now it felt as if my brain was just going to melt away. I\\nwanted to stay like that forever, to stay in his arms for the rest of my\\nlife. That’s how great it was.’ \"So I said to her, \"If it was so great, why didn’t you just stay with\\nWatanabe and keep doing it every day?’ But she said, \"No. Reiko, I\\nknew it would never happen again. I knew this was something that\\nwould come to me once, and leave, and never come back. This would\\nbe a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I had never felt anything like it before,\\nand I\\'ve never felt anything like it since. I’ve never felt that I wanted to\\ndo it again, and I\\'ve never grown wet like that again.’ \"Of course, I explained to her that this was something that often\\nhappened to young women and that, in most cases, it cures itself with\\nage. And, after all, it \\nhad\\n worked that one time: there was no need to\\nworry it wouldn\\'t happen again. I myself had had all kinds of trouble\\nwhen I was first married. \"But she said. \"No, that’s not it, Reiko. I\\'m not worried about that at\\nall. I just don’t want anybody going inside me again. I just don’t want\\nto be violated like that again - by anybody\\'.\" I drank my beer, and Reiko finished her second cigarette. The cat\\nstretched itself in Reiko\\'s lap, found a new position and went back to\\nsleep. Reiko seemed at a loss how to go on until she had lit her third\\ncigarette. \"After that, Naoko began to sob. I sat on the edge of her bed and stroked her hair. \"Don\\'t worry,\\' I said, \"everything is going to be all\\nright. A beautiful, young girl like you has \\ngot\\n to have a man to hold\\nher and make her happy.\\' Naoko was drenched in sweat and tears. I\\ngot a bath towel and dried her face and body. Even her panties were\\nsoaked, so I helped her out of them - now wait a minute, don\\'t get any strange ideas, there was\\nnothing funny going on. We always used to bathe together. She was\\nlike my little sister.\" \"I know, I know,\" I said. \"Well, anyway, Naoko said she wanted me to hold her. I said it was\\nfar too hot for holding, but she said it was the last time we\\'d be seeing\\neach other, so I held her. Just for a while. With a bath towel between\\nus so our sweaty bodies wouldn\\'t stick to each other. And when she\\ncalmed down, I dried her off again, got her nightdress on her and put\\nher to bed. She fell sound asleep straight away. Or maybe she was just\\npretending to sleep. Whatever, she looked so sweet and lovely that\\nnight, she had the face of a girl of 13 or 14 who’s never had a bit of\\nharm done to her since the day she was bom. I saw that look on her\\nface, and I knew I could let myself fall asleep with an easy heart. When I woke at six in the morning, she was gone. Her nightdress was\\nthere, where she had dropped it, but her clothes and trainers and the\\ntorch I always keep by my pillow were missing. I knew immediately\\nthat something was wrong. I mean, the very fact that she had taken the\\ntorch meant she had left in the dark. I checked her desk just in case,\\nand there was the note: \\nPlease give all my clothes to Reiko. I\\n woke\\nup everybody straight away, and we took different paths to look for\\nher. We searched every inch of the place, from the insides of the\\ndorms to the surrounding woods. It took us five hours to find her.\\nShe’d even brought her own rope.\" Reiko sighed and patted the cat. \"Want some tea?\" I asked. \"Yes, thanks,\" said Reiko. I boiled water and brought a pot of tea back to the veranda. Sundown\\nwas approaching. The daylight had grown weak, and long shadows of\\ntrees stretched to our feet. I sipped my tea and looked at the strangely\\nrandom garden with its funny mix of yellow globeflowers and pink\\nazaleas and tall, green nandins. \"So then the ambulance came and took Naoko away and the police\\nstarted questioning me. Not that there was much doubt. There was a\\nkind of suicide note, and it had obviously been a suicide, and they\\ntook it for granted that suicide was just one of those things that mental\\npatients \\ndid. So\\n it was pretty pro forma. As soon as they left, I\\ntelegraphed you.\" \"What a sad little funeral it was,\" I said. \"Her family was obviously\\nupset that I knew Naoko had died. I\\'m sure they didn\\'t want people to\\nknow it was suicide. I probably shouldn\\'t even have been there. Which\\nmade me feel even worse. As soon as I got back, I hit the road.\" \"Hey, Watanabe, let\\'s go for a walk. We can shop for something to\\nmake for dinner, maybe. I\\'m starving.\" \"Sure. Is there something you want to eat?\" \"Sukiyaki,\" she said. \"I haven\\'t had anything like that for years. I used\\nto \\ndream\\n about sukiyaki - just stuffing myself with beef and green\\nonions and noodles and roasted tofu and greens.\" \"Sure, we can have that, but I don\\'t have a sukiyaki pan.\" \"Just leave it\\nto me. I\\'ll borrow one from your landlord.\" She ran off to the main\\nhouse and came back with a good sized pan and gas cooker and rubber hose. \"Not bad, eh?\" \"Not bad!\" We bought all the ingredients at the little shops in the neighbourhood -\\nbeef, eggs, vegetables, tofu. I picked out a fairly decent white wine. I\\ntried to pay, but Reiko insisted on paying for everything. \"Think how the family would laugh at me if they heard I let my\\nnephew pay for the food!\" said Reiko. \"Besides, I\\'m carrying a fair amount of cash. So don\\'t worry. I wasn\\'t about to leave the sanatorium\\nbroke.\" Reiko washed the rice and put it on to boil while I arranged everything\\nfor cooking on the veranda. When everything was ready, Reiko took\\nout her guitar and appeared to be testing it with a slow Bach fugue. On\\nthe hard parts she would purposely slow down or speed up or make it\\ndetached or sentimental, listening with obvious pleasure to the variety\\nof sounds she could draw from the instrument. When she played the\\nguitar, Reiko looked like a 17-year-old girl enjoying the sight of a new\\ndress. Her eyes sparkled, and she pouted with just the hint of a smile.\\nWhen she had finished the piece, she leaned back against a pillar and\\nlooked up at the sky as though deep in thought. \"Do you mind if I talk to you?\" I asked. \"Not at all,\" she said. \"I was just thinking how hungry I am.\" \"Aren\\'t you planning to see your husband or your daughter while\\nyou\\'re here? They must be in Tokyo somewhere.\" \"Close enough. Yokohama. But no, I don’t plan to see them. I\\'m sure I\\ntold you before: it\\'s better for them if they don\\'t have anything more to\\ndo with me. They\\'ve started a new life. And I\\'d just feel terrible if I\\nsaw them. No, the best thing is to keep away.\" She crumpled up her empty box of Seven Stars cigarettes and took a\\nnew one from her suitcase. She cut the seal and put a cigarette in her\\nmouth, but she didn\\'t light up. \"I\\'m finished as a human being,\" she said. \"All you\\'re looking at is the\\nlingering memory of what I used to be. The most important part of\\nme, what used to be inside, died years ago, and I\\'m just functioning by\\nauto-memory.\" \"But I like you now, Reiko, the way you are, lingering memory or\\nwhatever. And what I have to say about it may not make any\\ndifference, but I\\'m really glad that you\\'re wearing Naoko\\'s clothes.\"\\nReiko smiled and lit her cigarette with a lighter. \"For such a young\\nman, you know how to make a woman happy.\" I felt myself reddening. \"I\\'m just saying what I really think.\" \"Sure, I\\nknow,\" said Reiko, smiling. When the rice was done soon after that, I\\noiled the pan and arranged the ingredients for sukiyaki. \"Tell me this isn\\'t a dream,\" said Reiko, sniffing the air. \"No, this is 100 per cent realistic sukiyaki,\" I said. \"Empirically\\nspeaking, of course.\" Instead of talking, we attacked the sukiyaki with our chopsticks, drank\\nlots of beer, and finished up with rice. Seagull turned up, attracted by\\nthe smell, so we shared our meat with her. When we had eaten our fill,\\nwe sat leaning against the porch pillars looking at the moon. \"Satisfied?\" I asked. \"Totally,\" she groaned. \"I\\'ve never eaten so much in my life.\" \"What do you want to do now?\" \"Have a smoke and go to a public bath. My hair\\'s a mess. I need to\\nwash it.\" \"No problem. There\\'s one down the street.\" \"Tell me, Watanabe, if you don’t mind. Have you slept with that girl\\nMidori?\" \"You mean have we had sex? Not yet. We decided not to until things\\nget sorted out.\" \"Well, now they\\'re sorted out, wouldn\\'t you say?\" I shook my head. \"Now that Naoko\\'s dead, you mean?\" \"No, not that. You made your decision long before Naoko died - that\\nyou could never leave Midori. Whether Naoko is alive or dead, it has\\nnothing to do with your decision. You chose Midori. Naoko chose to\\ndie. You\\'re all grown up now, so you have to take responsibility for\\nyour choices. Otherwise, you ruin everything.\" \"But I can\\'t forget her,\" I said. \"I told Naoko I would go on waiting for\\nher, but I couldn\\'t do it. I turned my back on her in the end. I’m not\\nsaying anyone\\'s to blame: it\\'s a problem for me myself. I do think that\\nthings would have worked out the same way even if I hadn\\'t turned\\nmy back on her. Naoko was choosing death all along. But that\\'s beside the point. I can\\'t forgive myself. You tell me there\\'s nothing I can do\\nabout a natural change in feelings, but my relationship with Naoko\\nwas not that simple. If you stop and think about it, she and I were\\nbound together at the border between life and death. It was like that\\nfor us from the start.\" \"If you feel some kind of pain with regard to Naoko\\'s death, I would\\nadvise you to keep on feeling that pain for the rest of your life. And if\\nthere\\'s something you can learn from it, you should do that, too. But\\nquite aside from that, you should be happy with Midori. Your pain has\\nnothing to do with your relationship with her. If you hurt her any more\\nthan you already have, the wound could be too deep to fix. So, hard as\\nit may be, you have to be strong. You have to grow up more, be more\\nof an adult. I left the sanatorium and came all the way up here to\\nTokyo to tell you that - all the way on that coffin of a train.\" \"I understand what you\\'re telling me,\" I said to Reiko, \"but I\\'m still not\\nprepared to follow through on it. I mean, that was \\nsuch\\n a sad little\\nfuneral! No one should have to die like that.\" Reiko stretched out her hand and stroked my head. \"We all have to die\\nlike that sometime. I will, and so will you.\" We took the five-minute walk along the river bank to the local public\\nbaths and came home feeling more refreshed. I opened the bottle of\\nwine and we sat on the veranda drinking it. \"Hey, Watanabe, could you bring out another glass?\" \"Stue,\" I said. \"But what for?\" \"We\\'re going to have otu own funeral for Naoko, just the two of us.\\nOne that\\'s not so sad.\" When I handed her the glass, Reiko filled it to the brim and set it on\\nthe stone lantern in the garden. Then she sat on the veranda, leaning\\nagainst a pillar, guitar in her arms, and smoked a cigarette. \"And now could you bring out a box of matches? Make it the biggest one you can find.\" I brought out an economy-size box of kitchen matches and sat down\\nnext to her. \"Now what I want you to do is lay down a match every time I play a\\nsong, just set them in a row. I\\'m going to play every song I can think\\nof.\" First she played a soft, lovely rendition of Henry Mancini\\'s \"Dear\\nHeart\". \"You gave a recording of this to Naoko, didn\\'t you?\" she asked. \"I did. For Christmas the year before last. She really liked that song.\" \"I like it, too,\" said Reiko. \"So sweet and beautiful ...\" and she ran\\nthrough a few bars of the melody one more time before taking another\\nsip of wine. \"I wonder how many songs I can play before I get\\ncompletely drunk. This’ll be a nice funeral, don\\'t you think - not so\\nsad?\" Reiko moved on to the Beatles, playing \"Norwegian Wood\",\\n\"Yesterday\", \"Michelle\", and \"Something\". She sang and played\\n\"Here Comes the Sun\", then played \"The Fool on the Hill\". I laid\\nseven matches in a row. \"Seven songs,\" said Reiko, sipping more wine and smoking another\\ncigarette. \"Those guys sure knew something about the sadness of life,\\nand gentleness.\" By \"those guys\" Reiko of course meant John Lennon. Paul McCartney\\nand George Harrison. After a short breather, Reiko crushed her\\ncigarette out and picked up her guitar again. She played \"Penny Lane\",\\n\"Blackbird\", \"Julia\", \"When I\\'m 64\", \"Nowhere Man\", \"And I Love\\nHer\", and \"Hey Jude\". \"How many songs is that?\" \"Fourteen,\" I said. She sighed and asked me, \"How about you? Can you play something -\\nmaybe one song?\" \"No way. I’m terrible.\" \"So play it terribly.\" I brought out my guitar and stumbled my way through \"Up on the\\nRoof\". Reiko took a rest, smoking and drinking. When I was through,\\nshe applauded. Next she played a guitar transcription of Ravel\\'s \"Pavanne for a Dying\\nQueen\" and a beautifully clean rendition of Debussy\\'s \"Claire de\\nLune\". \"I mastered both of these after Naoko died,\" said Reiko. \"To the end.\\nher taste in music never rose above the sentimental.\" She performed a few Bacharach songs next: \"Close to You\",\\n\"Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head\", \"Walk on By\", \"Wedding Bell\\nBlues\". \"Twenty,\" I said. \"I\\'m like a human jukebox!\" exclaimed Reiko. \"My professors would\\nfaint if they could see me now.\" She went on sipping and puffing and playing: several bossa novas,\\nRogers and Hart, Gershwin, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Carole King,\\nThe Beach Boys, Stevie Wonder. Kyu Sakamoto\\'s \"Sukiyaki Song\",\\n\"Blue Velvet\", \"Green Fields\". Sometimes she would close her eyes\\nand nod or hum to the melody. When the wine was gone, we turned to whisky. The wine in the glass\\nin the garden I poured over the stone lantern and replaced it with\\nwhisky. \"How\\'s our count going?\" Reiko asked. \"Forty-eight,\" I said. For our forty-ninth song Reiko played \"Eleanor Rigby\", and the\\nfiftieth was another performance of \"Norwegian Wood\". After that she\\nrested her hands and drank some whisky. \"Maybe that\\'s enough,\" she\\nsaid. \"It is,\" I answered. \"Amazing.\" Reiko looked me in the eye and said, \"Now listen to me, Watanabe. I\\nwant you to forget all about that sad little funeral you saw. Just remember this marvellous one of ours.\" I nodded. \"Here\\'s one more for good measure,\" she said, and for her fifty-first\\npiece she played her favourite Bach fugue. When she was through, she\\nsaid in a voice just above a whisper, \"How about doing it with me,\\nWatanabe?\" \"Strange,\" I said. \"I was thinking the same thing.\" We went inside and drew the curtains. Then, in the darkened room,\\nReiko and I sought out each other\\'s bodies as if it were the most\\nnatural thing in the world for us to do. I removed her blouse and\\ntrousers, and then her underwear. \"I\\'ve lived a strange life,\" said Reiko, \"but I never thought I’d have my\\npanties removed for me by a man 19 years my junior.\" \"Would you rather take them off yourself?\" \"No, go ahead. But don\\'t be too shocked at all my wrinkles.\" \"I like your wrinkles.\" \"You\\'re gonna make me cry,\" she whispered. I kissed her all over, taking special care to follow the wrinkled places\\nwith my tongue. She had the breasts of a little girl. I caressed them\\nand took her nipples in my teeth, then slid a finger inside her warm,\\nmoist vagina and began to move it. \"Wrong spot, Watanabe,\" Reiko whispered in my ear. \"That\\'s just a\\nwrinkle.\" \"I can\\'t believe you\\'re telling jokes at a time like this!\" \"Sorry,\" she said. \"I\\'m scared. I haven\\'t done this for years. I feel like\\na 17-year-old girl: I just went to visit a guy in his room, and all of a\\nsudden I\\'m naked.\" \"To tell you the truth, I feel as if I\\'m violating a 17-year-old girl.\" With my finger in her \"wrinkle\", I moved my lips up her neck to her\\near and took a nipple in my fingers. As her breathing intensified and\\nher throat began to tremble, I parted her long, slim legs and eased myself inside her. \"You\\'re not going to get me pregnant now, are you? You\\'re taking care\\nof that, right?\" Reiko murmured in my ear. \"I’d be so embarrassed if I\\ngot pregnant at this age.\" \"Don\\'t worry,\" I said. \"Just relax.\" When I was all the way in, she trembled and released a sigh.\\nCaressing her back, I moved inside her and then, without warning, I\\ncame. It was an intense, unstoppable ejaculation. I clutched at her as\\nmy semen pulsed into her warmth again and again. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I said. \"I couldn\\'t stop myself.\" \"Don’t be silly,\" Reiko said, giving me a little slap on the rump. \"You\\ndon\\'t have to worry about that. Do you always have that on your mind\\nwhen you\\'re doing it with girls?\" \"Yeah, pretty much.\" \"Well, you don\\'t have to think about it with me. Forget it. Just let yourself go as much as you like. Did it feel good?\" \"Fantastic.\\nThat\\'s why I couldn\\'t control myself.\" \"This is no time for controlling yourself. This is fine. It was\\ngreat for me, too.\" \"You know, Reiko,\" I said. \"What\\'s that?\" \"You ought to take a lover again. You\\'re terrific. It\\'s such a waste.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ll think about it,\" she said. \"But I wonder if people take lovers\\nand things in Asahikawa.\" Growing hard a few minutes later, I went inside her again. Reiko held\\nher breath and twisted beneath me. I moved slowly and quietly with\\nmy arms around her, and we talked. It felt wonderful to talk that way.\\nIf I said something funny and made her laugh, the tremors came into\\nme through my penis. We held each other like this for a very long\\ntime. \"Oh, this feels marvellous!\" Reiko said. \"Moving\\'s not bad either,\" I said. \"Go ahead. Give it a try.\" I lifted her hips and went in as far as I could go, then savoured the\\nsensation of moving in a circular pattern until, having enjoyed it to the\\nfull, I let myself come. Altogether, we joined our bodies four times that night. At the end each\\ntime, Reiko would lie in my arms trembling slightly, eyes closed, and\\nrelease a long sigh. \"I never have to do this again,\" said Reiko, \"for the rest of my life. Oh,\\nplease, Watanabe, tell me it\\'s true. Tell me I can relax now because\\nI\\'ve done enough to last a lifetime.\" \"Nobody can tell you that,\" I said. \"There\\'s no way of knowing.\" I tried to convince Reiko that taking a plane would be faster and\\neasier, but she insisted on going to Asahikawa by train. \"I like the ferry to Hokkaido. And I have no desire to fly through the\\nair,\" she said. I accompanied her to Ueno Station. She carried her\\nguitar and I carried her suitcase. We sat on a platform bench waiting\\nfor the train to pull in. Reiko wore the same tweed jacket and white\\ntrousers she had on when she arrived in Tokyo. \"Do you really think Asahikawa\\'s not such a bad place?\" she asked. \"It\\'s a nice town. I\\'ll visit you there soon.\" \"Really?\" I nodded. \"And I\\'ll write to you.\" \"I love your letters. Naoko burned all the ones you sent her. And they\\nwere such great letters too!\" \"Letters are just pieces of paper,\" I said. \"Burn them, and what stays in\\nyour heart will stay; keep them, and what\\nvanishes will vanish.\" \"You know, Watanabe, Asahikawa by myself. So be sure to write to me. Whenever I read\\nyour letters, I feel you\\'re right there next to me.\" \"If that\\'s what you want. I’ll write all the time. But don’t worry. I know you: you\\'ll do fine wherever you go.\" \"And another thing. I kind of feel like there\\'s something stuck inside\\nme. Could it be my imagination?\" \"Just a lingering memory,\" I said and smiled. Reiko smiled, too. \"Don\\'t forget about me,\" she said. \"I won\\'t forget you,\" I said. \"Ever.\" \"We may never meet again, but no matter where I go. I\\'ll always\\nremember you and Naoko.\" I saw that she was crying. Before I knew it, I was kissing her. Others\\non the platform were staring at us, but I didn’t care about such things\\nany more. We were alive, she and I. And all we had to think about was\\ncontinuing to live. \"Be happy,\" Reiko said to me as she boarded the train. \"I\\'ve given you\\nall the advice I have to give. There\\'s nothing left for me to say. Just be\\nhappy. Take my share and Naoko\\'s and combine them for yourself.\" We held hands for a moment, and then we parted. I phoned Midori. \"I have to talk to you,\" I said. \"I have a million things to talk to you\\nabout. A million things we have to talk about. All I want in this world\\nis you. I want to see you and talk. I want the two of us to begin\\neverything from the beginning.\" Midori responded with a long, long silence - the silence of all the\\nmisty rain in the world falling on all the new-mown lawns of the\\nworld. Forehead pressed against the glass, I shut my eyes and waited.\\nAt last, Midori\\'s quiet voice broke the silence: \"Where are you now?\"\\nWhere was I now? Gripping the receiver, I raised my head and turned to see what lay\\nbeyond the phone box. Where was I now? I had no idea. No idea at\\nall. Where was this place? All that flashed into my eyes were the\\ncountless shapes of people walking by to nowhere. Again and again I\\ncalled out for Midori from the dead centre of this place that was no place.'"
