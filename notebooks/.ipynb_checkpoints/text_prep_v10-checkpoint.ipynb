       "'19 \\n SHINJUKU STATION IS  enormous.  Every day nearly 3.5 million people pass through it, so many that the  Guinness Book of World Records  officially lists JR Shinjuku Station as the station with the ‘Most Passengers in the World.’  A number of railroad lines cross there, the main ones being the Chuo line, Sobu line, Yamanote line, Saikyo line, Shonan–Shinjuku line, and the Narita Express.  The rails intersect and combine in complex and convoluted ways.  There are sixteen platforms in total.  In addition, there are two private rail lines, the Odakyu line and the Keio line, and three subway lines plugged in, as it were, from the side.  It is a total maze.  During rush hour, that maze transforms into a sea of humanity, a sea that foams up, rages, and roars as it surges toward the entrances and exits.  Streams of people changing trains become entangled, giving rise to dangerous, swirling whirlpools.  No prophet, no matter how righteous, could part that fierce, turbulent sea. \\n It’s hard to believe that every morning and evening, five days a week, this overwhelming crush of human beings is dealt with efficiently, without any major problems, by a staff of station employees that no one would ever accuse of being adequate, in terms of numbers, to the task.  The morning rush hour is particularly problematic.  Everyone is scurrying to get to where they need to be, to punch their time clock, and no one’s in a great mood.  They’re still tired, half asleep, and riding the bursting-at-the-seams trains is physically and emotionally draining.  Only the very lucky manage to find a seat.  Tsukuru was always amazed that riots don’t break out, that there are no tragic, bloody disasters.  If a fanatical band of terrorists did happen to target one of these jam-packed stations or trains, it would be lethal, with a horrific loss of life.  For the people working on the rail lines, and the police, and, of course, the passengers, this remained the one unimaginable, nightmare scenario.  And there was no way to prevent it, even now, after such a nightmare  actually did  take place in Tokyo in the spring of 1995. \\n Station employees bark out endless announcements over the loudspeakers, a repetitious tune marking train departures plays constantly, the automated wickets silently input a huge amount of information from all the rail cards, tickets, and train passes they scan.  The long trains, their arrivals and departures timed down to the second, are like long-suffering, well-trained farm animals, systematically exhaling and inhaling people, impatiently closing their doors as they rush off toward the next station.  The crowds surge up and down the stairs, but if someone steps on your foot from behind and your shoe comes off, good luck ever retrieving it.  The shoe is sucked into the intense rush-hour quicksand, where it vanishes forever.  The person who suffers this fate has a long day ahead, clomping around on one shoe. \\n In the early 1990s, before Japan’s bubble economy burst, a leading newspaper in the U.S.  published a large photo taken on a winter’s morning of rush-hour commuters in Shinjuku Station (or possibly Tokyo Station – the same applies to both) heading down the stairs.  As if by agreement, all the commuters were gazing downward, their expressions strained and unhappy, looking more like lifeless fish packed in a can than people.  The article said, ‘Japan may be affluent, but most Japanese look like this, heads downcast and unhappy-looking.’  The photo became famous. \\n Tsukuru had no idea if most Japanese were, as the article claimed, unhappy.  But the real reason that most passengers descending the stairs at Shinjuku Station during their packed morning commute were looking down was less that they were unhappy than that they were concerned about their footing.  Don’t slip on the stairs, don’t lose a shoe – these are the major issues on the minds of the commuters in the mammoth station during rush hour.  There was no explanation of this, no context for the photograph.  Certainly it was hard to view this mass of people, clad in dark overcoats, their heads down, as happy.  And of course it’s logical to see a country where people can’t commute in the morning without fear of losing their shoes as an unhappy society. \\n Tsukuru wondered how much time people spend simply commuting to work every day.  Say the average commute was between an hour and an hour and a half.  That sounded about right.  If your typical office worker, working in Tokyo, married with a child or two, wanted to own his own house, the only choice was to live in the suburbs and spend that much time getting to work and back.  So two to three hours out of every twenty-four would be spent simply in the act of commuting.  If you were lucky, you might be able to read the newspaper or a paperback in the train.  Maybe you could listen to your iPod, to a Haydn symphony or a conversational Spanish lesson.  Some people might even close their eyes, lost in deep metaphysical speculation.  Still, it would be hard to call these two or three hours rewarding, quality time.  How much of one’s life was snatched away to simply vanish as a result of this (most likely) pointless movement from point A to point B?  And how much did this effort exhaust people, and wear them down? \\n But these were not issues that Tsukuru Tazaki, a railroad company employee tasked with designing stations, needed to worry about.  It wasn’t his life.  Let people live their own lives.  Each person should decide for himself how happy, or unhappy, our society might be.  All Tsukuru had to think about was what might be the safest and most efficient way to keep this massive flow of people moving.  For a job like this, reflection is not required, as it simply calls for accurate, tested, best practices.  He was no thinker or sociologist, but a mere engineer. \\n Tsukuru Tazaki loved to watch JR Shinjuku Station. \\n When he went to the station he would buy a platform ticket from the machine and go upstairs to the platform between Tracks 9 and 10.  This is where express trains on the Chuo line came and went, long-distance trains to places like Matsumoto and Kofu.  Compared to the platform for commuters, there were far fewer passengers, fewer trains arriving and departing.  He could sit on a bench and leisurely observe what went on in the station. \\n Tsukuru visited railroad stations like other people enjoy attending concerts, watching movies, dancing in clubs, watching sports, and window shopping.  When he was at a loose end, with nothing to do, he headed to a station.  When he felt anxious or needed to think, his feet carried him, once again of their own accord, to a station.  He’d sit quietly on a bench on the platform, sip coffee he bought at a kiosk, and check the arrival and departure times against the pocket-sized timetable he always carried in his briefcase.  He could spend hours doing this.  Back when he was a college student he used to examine the station’s layout, the passenger flow, the movements of the station staff, writing detailed observations in his notebook, but he was beyond that now. \\n An express train slows down as it pulls up to the platform.  The doors open and passengers alight, one after another.  Just watching this made him feel calm and content.  When trains arrived and departed right on schedule, he felt proud, even if the station wasn’t one his company had helped to construct.  A quiet, simple sense of pride.  A cleaning team quickly boards the train, collecting trash and turning the swivel seats around so they all neatly face forward.  A new crew, wearing hats and uniforms, boards and briskly runs through a checklist.  The destination sign is replaced, along with the train’s designated number.  Everything proceeds smoothly, efficiently, without a hitch, down to the second.  This is Tsukuru Tazaki’s world. \\n At Helsinki Central Station he had done the same thing.  He got a simple train schedule, sat down on a bench, and, sipping hot coffee from a paper cup, watched the long-distance trains arrive and depart.  He checked their destinations on a map, and where they’d come from.  He observed the passengers getting off the trains, watched others rushing toward their respective platforms to board more trains, and followed the movements of the uniformed station employees and train crews.  As always, doing this calmed him.  Time passed, smoothly, homogeneously.  Other than not being able to understand the PA announcements, it was no different from being in Shinjuku Station.  The protocol for operating a railway station was pretty much the same throughout the world, the whole operation reliant on precise, skillful professionalism.  This aroused a natural response in him, a sure sense that he was in the right place. \\n On Tuesday when Tsukuru finished work it was after eight.  At this time of night he was the only one left in his office.  The work he had left to do wasn’t so urgent that he needed to stay late to finish it, but he was meeting Sara on Wednesday evening and he wanted to complete any leftover tasks before then. \\n He decided to call it a day, switched off his computer, locked up important disks and documents in a drawer, and turned off the light.  He left through the company’s rear entrance, saying goodnight to the security guard he knew by sight. \\n ‘Have a good night, sir,’ the guard said to him. \\n He thought of having dinner somewhere but wasn’t hungry.  Still, he didn’t feel like going straight home, so he headed for JR Shinjuku Station.  This evening, too, he bought coffee at a kiosk.  It was a typical muggy Tokyo summer night, and his back was sweaty, but still he preferred hot black coffee, the steam rising off it, to a cold drink.  It was just a habit. \\n As always, on Platform 9 the final night train bound for Matsumoto was preparing for departure.  The crew walked the length of the train, checking with practiced, diligent eyes that everything was in order.  The train was not as sleek as a Shinkansen bullet train, but Tsukuru liked the plain no-nonsense trains, these familiar E257 models.  The train would proceed to Shiojiri along the Chuo line, then run on the Shinonoi line to Matsumoto, and arrive in Matsumoto at five minutes till midnight.  Until Hachioji it was still in an urban area and had to keep the noise down, but after that it ran through the mountains, where there were many curves, so it never could get up to the maximum speed.  For the distance involved, the trip took a long time. \\n There was still some time before the train opened its doors for boarding, yet passengers were hurriedly buying boxed dinners, snacks, cans of beer, and magazines at the kiosk.  Some had white iPod headphones in their ears, already off in their own little worlds.  Others palmed smartphones, thumbing out texts, some talking so loudly into their phones that their voices rose above the blaring PA announcements.  Tsukuru spotted a young couple, seated close together on a bench, happily sharing secrets.  A pair of sleepy-looking five- or six-year-old twin boys, with their mother and father dragging them along by their hands, were whisked past where Tsukuru sat.  The boys clutched small game devices.  Two young foreign men hefted heavy-looking backpacks, while a young woman was lugging a cello case.  A woman with a stunning profile passed by.  Everyone was boarding a night train, heading to a far-off destination.  Tsukuru envied them.  At least they had a place they needed to go to. \\n Tsukuru Tazaki had no place he needed to go. \\n He realized that he had never actually been to Matsumoto, or Kofu.  Or Shiojiri.  Not even to the much closer town of Hachioji.  He had watched countless express trains for Matsumoto depart from this platform, but it had never occurred to him that there was a possibility he could board one.  Until now he had never thought of it.  Why is that?  he wondered. \\n Tsukuru imagined himself boarding this train and heading for Matsumoto.  It wasn’t exactly impossible.  And it didn’t seem like such a terrible idea.  He’d suddenly gotten it into his head, after all, to take off for Finland, so why not Matsumoto?  What sort of town was it?  he wondered.  What kind of lives did people lead there?  But he shook his head and erased these thoughts.  Tomorrow morning it would be impossible to get back to Tokyo in time for work.  He knew that much without consulting the timetable.  And he was meeting Sara tomorrow night.  It was a very important day for him.  He couldn’t just take off for Matsumoto on a whim. \\n He drank the rest of his now-lukewarm coffee and tossed the paper cup into a nearby garbage bin. \\n Tsukuru Tazaki had nowhere he had to go .  This was like a running theme of his life.  He had no place he had to go to, no place to come back to.  He never did, and he didn’t now.  The only place for him was  where he was now . \\n No, he thought.  That’s not entirely true. \\n At one point in his life he did have a place he needed to go to.  In high school, he had his heart set on going to an engineering college in Tokyo and majoring in railroad station design.  That was  the place he needed to go .  And he studied hard to make sure he could do so.  His academic advisor had coolly warned him that with his grades, he had only a 20 percent chance of getting into that school, but he’d done his best and somehow surmounted that hurdle.  He had never studied so hard in his life.  He wasn’t cut out for competing with others for rank and grades, but given a set goal he put his heart and soul into it.  He exerted himself beyond anything he’d ever imagined, and the experience was a new, and precious, discovery for him of his own capabilities. \\n As a result, Tsukuru left Nagoya and ended up living alone in Tokyo.  In Tokyo he longed to return to his hometown as soon as he could, even if only for a short time, to see his friends again.  At that point Nagoya was the place he  needed to go back to .  He shuttled back and forth between two different places for a little over a year.  But then, without warning, the cycle was broken. \\n After this, he no longer had a place to go, or a place to which he could return.  His house was still in Nagoya, his mother and eldest sister still living there, his room the same as he’d left it.  His other older sister was also living in the city.  Once or twice a year he made an obligatory visit and was always warmly received, but there was nothing he needed to talk to his mother or sister about, and being with them never brought back any nostalgic feelings.  What they sought from him was the  Tsukuru of old , a person he had left behind and no longer needed.  To revive that person, and present him to his family, necessitated that he play a role that made him uncomfortable.  The streets of Nagoya now felt remote and dreary.  There was nothing there he wanted, nothing that called up even a hint of warmth. \\n Tokyo, meanwhile, was just the place he  happened  to end up.  It was where he had attended school, where his job was located.  Professionally it was the place he belonged, but beyond that, the city meant nothing to him.  In Tokyo he lived a well-ordered, quiet life.  Like a refugee in a foreign land, not making waves, not causing any trouble, being ever cautious so that his residence permit was not revoked.  He lived there as if he were a refugee from his own life.  And Tokyo was the ideal place for someone seeking a life of anonymity. \\n He had no one he could call a close friend.  A few girlfriends entered his life along the way, but they hadn’t stayed together.  Peaceful relationships followed by amicable breakups.  Not a single person had really climbed inside his heart.  He had not been seeking that sort of relationship, and most likely the women he went out with hadn’t desired him that much either.  So they were even. \\n It’s like my life came to a halt at age twenty, Tsukuru Tazaki thought, as he sat on the bench in Shinjuku Station.  The days that came afterward had no real weight or substance.  The years passed by, quietly, like a gentle breeze.  Leaving no scars behind, no sorrow, rousing no strong emotions, leaving no happiness or memories worth mentioning.  And now he was entering middle age.  No – he still had a few years to go before that.  But it was true that he was no longer young. \\n In a sense, Eri was a refugee from life as well.  She too carried emotional scars, scars that had led her to leave everything behind and abandon her country.  She had chosen a new world, Finland, on her own.  And now she had a husband and two daughters, as well as her work making pottery, work in which she completely immersed herself.  She had a summer cottage by the lake, and a chipper small dog.  She’d learned Finnish, and was steadily constructing her own little universe.  That makes her different from me, Tsukuru thought. \\n He glanced at the Heuer watch on his left wrist.  It was 8:50.  Passengers had begun boarding the express train.  One after another, people dragged their luggage aboard, plunking themselves down in their designated seats, stowing their bags in the overhead racks, settling down in the air-conditioned cars, sipping cold drinks.  He could see them through the windows of the train. \\n He’d inherited the watch from his father.  One of the few tangible things he’d received.  It was a beautiful antique, from the early 1960s.  If you didn’t wear it for three days, the mechanism would wind down and the hands would stop.  An inconvenience, but that’s what Tsukuru liked about it.  It was a purely mechanical device, a piece of craftsmanship.  No quartz or a single microchip inside, everything operated by delicate springs and gears.  It had been working faithfully, without a rest, for a half century and was, even now, surprisingly accurate. \\n Tsukuru had never bought a watch himself, not once in his whole life.  When he was young, someone inevitably gave him a cheap one, which he used without much thought.  As long as it kept the right time, he didn’t care what he wore.  That was the extent of his feelings for watches.  A simple Casio digital watch did the trick.  So when his father died, and he was given this expensive wristwatch as a keepsake, again it aroused no special feelings one way or the other.  He had to make sure to wear it regularly so it didn’t wind down, but once he got used to this, he found that he had a great fondness for the watch.  He enjoyed the weight and heft of it, the faint mechanical whir it made.  He found himself checking the time more often than before, and each time he did, his father’s shadow passed, faintly, through his mind. \\n Truth be told, he didn’t remember his father all that well, nor did he have particularly warm memories of him.  He could not recall ever going anywhere with his father, from the time he was small until he was grown up, or even having a friendly talk, just the two of them.  His father was basically an uncommunicative person (at least, at home, he barely spoke), and besides, work kept him so busy that he was rarely around.  Only now did Tsukuru realize that his father might have been keeping a mistress somewhere. \\n To Tsukuru he felt less like his real father than some well-placed relative who often visited.  Tsukuru was essentially raised by his mother and his two older sisters.  He knew next to nothing about what sort of life his father had led, his thoughts and values, and what he actually did day to day.  What he did know was that his father had been born in Gifu, had lost both parents while still a boy, was taken in by a paternal uncle who was a Buddhist priest, managed to graduate from high school, started a company from scratch, had tremendous success, and ultimately built up a substantial fortune.  Unlike most people who had struggled in life, he preferred not to dwell on the trials he’d gone through, perhaps not wishing to relive the hard times.  At any rate, it was clear that his father had an extraordinary head for business, the talent to immediately obtain what he needed, and jettison everything he didn’t.  Tsukuru’s oldest sister had, in part, inherited this talent for business from her father, while the younger sister had also, in part, inherited her mother’s cheerful sociability.  Neither of these qualities had been passed on to Tsukuru. \\n His father had smoked over fifty cigarettes a day, and had died of lung cancer.  When Tsukuru went to visit him at the hospital in Nagoya, he could no longer speak.  His father seemed to want to tell him something, but couldn’t do so.  A month later he died in his hospital bed.  His father left him the one-bedroom condo in Jiyugaoka, a bank account with a fair amount of money in his name, and this Heuer self-winding wristwatch. \\n No, there  was  one other thing his father had left him.  His name – Tsukuru Tazaki. \\n When Tsukuru announced that he wanted to study at an engineering college in Tokyo, his father seemed deeply disappointed that his only son had no interest in taking over the real estate business he had worked so hard to build.  Still, he fully supported Tsukuru’s desire to become an engineer.  ‘If that’s what you want,’ his father had told him, ‘then you should go to the college in Tokyo, and I’ll be happy to pay for it.  Learning a technical skill and building real objects is a good thing.  It contributes to society.  Study hard,’ he’d said, ‘and build as many stations as you like.’  His father seemed pleased that the name he’d chosen – Tsukuru – had turned out to be so appropriate.  This was probably the first and last time Tsukuru had made his father happy, certainly the only time he had seen his father so openly pleased. \\n At exactly 9 p.m., right on schedule, the express train for Matsumoto pulled away from the platform.  Seated on the bench, Tsukuru watched as its lights faded down the tracks, as the train sped up and finally disappeared into the summer night.  Once the last car was no longer visible, everything around him felt suddenly deserted.  Even the lights of the city seemed to have faded a notch, like when a play is over and the lights go out after the last act.  He got up from the bench and slowly made his way down the stairs. \\n He left Shinjuku Station, went into a nearby restaurant, sat at the counter, and ordered meatloaf and potato salad.  He barely finished half of each.  Not that the food tasted bad.  This restaurant was famous for its delicious meatloaf.  He just had no appetite.  As always, he only finished half his beer. \\n He rode the train home and took a shower, and carefully scrubbed his whole body with soap.  He then put on an olive-green bathrobe (a gift from a girlfriend back on his thirtieth birthday) and sat down on a chair on the balcony, letting the night breeze waft over him as he listened to the muffled din of the city.  It was nearly 11 p.m., but he wasn’t tired. \\n Tsukuru remembered those days in college when all he’d thought about was dying.  Already sixteen years ago.  Back then he was convinced that if he merely focused on what was going on inside of him, his heart would finally stop of its own accord.  That if he intensely concentrated his feelings on one fixed point, like a lens focused on paper, bursting it into flames, his heart would suffer a fatal blow.  More than anything he hoped for this.  But months passed, and contrary to his expectation, his heart didn’t stop.  The heart apparently doesn’t stop that easily. \\n From far off in the distance, he heard a helicopter.  It seemed to be getting nearer, the sound growing louder.  He looked up at the sky, trying to catch sight of it.  It felt like a messenger bringing some vital news.  But he never saw it, the sound of the propellers fading, then disappearing completely to the west, leaving behind only the soft, vague hum of the city at night. \\n Maybe back then Shiro had been hoping to break up their group.  This possibility suddenly struck him.  Seated on a chair on the balcony, he slowly filled out this hypothesis. \\n Their group in high school had been so close, so very tight.  They accepted each other as they were, understood each other, and each of them found a deep contentment and happiness in their relationship, their little group.  But such bliss couldn’t last forever.  At some point paradise would be lost.  They would each mature at different rates, take different paths in life.  As time passed, an unavoidable sense of unease would develop among them, a subtle fault line, no doubt turning into something less than  subtle . \\n Shiro’s nerves might not have been able to stand the pressure of  what had to come , the trauma of the inevitable end of this tight-knit group of friends.  She may have felt she had to unravel the emotional bonds of the group herself or else be caught up, fatally, in its collapse, like a castaway sucked down into the abyss by the whirlpool of a sinking ship. \\n Tsukuru could, to an extent, understand that feeling.  Now  he could, that is.  The tension of suppressed sexual feelings began to take on greater significance than Tsukuru could imagine.  The graphic sexual dreams he had later were probably an extension of that tension.  And that tension must have had some effect – what, exactly, he had no idea – on the other four as well. \\n Shiro had wanted to escape from that situation.  Maybe she couldn’t stand that kind of relationship anymore, the close relationship that required constant maintenance of one’s feelings.  Shiro was, unquestionably, the most sensitive of the five, so she must have picked up on that friction before anyone else.  But she was unable, at least on her own, to escape outside that circle.  She didn’t possess the strength.  So she set Tsukuru up as the apostate.  At that point, Tsukuru was the first member to step outside the circle, the weakest link in the community.  To put it another way, he deserved to be punished.  So when someone raped her (who did it and what the circumstances were behind her rape and subsequent pregnancy would remain eternal mysteries), in the midst of the hysteric confusion brought on by shock, she ripped away that weakest link, like yanking the emergency cord to stop a train. \\n Viewed in this way, many things fell into place.  Back then Shiro followed her instincts and chose Tsukuru as a stepping stone, a way for her to reach outside the walls of their group.  Shiro must have had a gut feeling that Tsukuru, even put in that awful position, would be able to survive – just as Eri, too, had arrived at the same conclusion. \\n Tsukuru Tazaki, always cool and collected, always doing things at his own pace. \\n Tsukuru got up from the chair on the balcony and went inside.  He took a bottle of Cutty Sark from a shelf, poured some into a glass, then carried it back out to the porch.  He sat down again and, for a time, pressed the fingers of his right hand against his temple. \\n No, he thought, I’m not cool and collected, and I’m not always doing things at my own pace.  It’s just a question of balance.  I’m just good at habitually shifting the weight I carry around from one side of the fulcrum to the other, distributing it.  Maybe this strikes others as cool.  But it isn’t an easy operation.  It takes more time than it seems.  And even if I do find the right balance, that doesn’t lessen the total weight one bit. \\n And yet he was able to forgive Shiro, or Yuzu.  She carried within her a deep wound and had only been trying, desperately, to protect herself.  She was a weak person, someone who lacked the hard, tough exterior with which to guard herself.  It was all she could do to find a safe refuge when danger came, and she couldn’t be particular about the methods.  Who could blame her?  But in the end, no matter how far she ran, she couldn’t escape, for the dark shadow of violence followed her relentlessly.  What Eri dubbed an  evil spirit .  And on a quiet, cold, and rainy May night,  it  knocked at her door, and strangled her lovely slim throat.  In a place, and time, that had, most likely, already been decided. \\n Tsukuru went back inside, picked up the phone, and without thinking much about what he was doing, pushed the speed-dial number for Sara.  The phone rang three times before he thought better of it and hung up.  It was already late.  And he would be seeing her tomorrow.  Then he would see her and talk to her in person.  He shouldn’t short-circuit the process before he saw her.  He knew that.  Still, he wanted to hear Sara’s voice, right now.  The feeling welled up inside him so overwhelmingly that it was hard to suppress the urge. \\n He placed the record of Lazar Berman’s performance of  Years of Pilgrimage  on the turntable, and lowered the needle.  He turned his attention to the music.  The scene of the lakeside at Hämeenlinna came to him.  The white lace curtain rustling in the breeze, the sound of the little boat rocked by the waves, slapping against the pier.  The birds in the forest patiently teaching their tiny bird babies how to chirp.  The citrusy smell Eri’s shampoo had left on her hair.  The dense weight of the life force, the will to survive, within the ample softness of her breasts.  The hard phlegm spat out in the weeds by the dour old man who’d shown him the way.  The dog wagging its tail excitedly as it leaped into the back of the Renault.  As he traced memories of these scenes, the pain in his chest that he’d felt returned once more. \\n Tsukuru drank the Cutty Sark, savoring the fragrance.  His stomach grew faintly warm.  From the summer of his sophomore year in college until the following winter, when every day brought thoughts of dying and nothing else, he’d had one small glass of whiskey at night like this.  Without it, he hadn’t been able to sleep. \\n The phone suddenly rang.  He stood up from the sofa, gently raised the needle from the record, and stood in front of the phone.  It had to be Sara.  No one else would call him at this hour of night.  She knew he’d called and was calling him back.  As the phone rang a dozen times Tsukuru hesitated, unsure if he should answer.  He bit his lip hard, held his breath, and stared intently at the phone, like a person standing far away, off studying the details of a difficult formula on a blackboard, trying to puzzle it out.  But he could find no clues.  The phone stopped ringing, followed by silence.  A deep, suggestive silence. \\n To fill in the silence Tsukuru lowered the needle onto the record again, went back to the sofa, and settled in to listen to the music.  This time he tried his best not to think of anything in particular.  With his eyes closed and his mind a blank, he focused solely on the music.  Finally, as if lured in by the melody, images flashed behind his eyelids, one after the next, appearing, then disappearing.  A series of images without concrete form or meaning, rising up from the dark margins of consciousness, soundlessly crossing into the visible realm, only to be sucked back into the margins on the other side and vanish once again.  Like the mysterious outline of microorganisms swimming across the circular field of vision of a microscope. \\n Fifteen minutes later the phone rang again, and again he did not answer it.  This time he stayed seated, listening to the music, gazing at the black phone.  He didn’t count how many times it rang.  Eventually it stopped, and all he could hear was the music. \\n Sara, he thought.  I want to hear your voice.  I want to hear it more than anything.  But right now I can’t talk. \\n Tomorrow Sara may choose that other man, not me, Tsukuru thought as he lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes.  It’s entirely possible, and for her it may well be the right choice. \\n What kind of person this other man was, what sort of relationship they had, how long they’d been seeing each other – all of this Tsukuru had no way of knowing.  And he didn’t want to know, either.  One thing he could say at this point was this: he had very little he could give her.  Limited in amount, and in kind, the contents negligible.  Would anybody really want the little he had to give? \\n Sara said she has feelings for me.  He had no reason to doubt it.  But there are countless things in the world for which affection is not enough.  Life is long, and sometimes cruel.  Sometimes victims are needed.  Someone has to take on that role.  And human bodies are fragile, easily damaged.  Cut them, and they bleed. \\n If Sara doesn’t choose me tomorrow, he thought, I may  really  die.  Die in reality, or die figuratively – there isn’t much difference between the two.  But this time I definitely will take my last breath.  Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki will lose any last hint of color and quietly exit the world.  All will become a void, the only thing that remains a hard, frozen clump of dirt. \\n It doesn’t matter.  The same thing has nearly happened a few times already, and it wouldn’t be strange if it actually did this time.  It’s just a physical phenomenon, no more.  The spring on a wound watch gets steadily looser, the torque grows closer and closer to zero, until the gears stop altogether and the hands come to rest at a set position.  Silence descends.  Isn’t that all it is? \\n He slipped into bed just before the date changed, and switched off the bedside lamp.  How nice it would be to dream of Sara, Tsukuru thought.  An erotic dream.  Or one that wasn’t – either would be good.  If possible, though, a dream that wasn’t too sad.  A dream in which he could touch her body would be more than he could ask for.  It was, after all, just a dream. \\n He longed for her more than he could say.  It was a wonderful thing to be able to truly want someone like this – the feeling was so real, so overpowering.  He hadn’t felt this way in ages.  Maybe he never had before.  Not that everything about it was wonderful: his chest ached, he found it hard to breathe, and a fear, a dark oscillation, had hold of him.  But now even that kind of ache had become an important part of the affection he felt.  He didn’t want to let that feeling slip from his grasp.  Once lost, he might never happen across that warmth again.  If he had to lose it, he would rather lose himself. \\n Tsukuru, you need to hang on to her.  No matter what.  If you let her go now, you might not ever have anyone else in your life. \\n Eri was right.  No matter what, he had to make Sara his.  But this wasn’t something he could decide on his own.  It was a question decided by two people, between one heart and another.  Something had to be given, and something had to be accepted.  Everything depends on tomorrow.  If Sara chooses me, accepts me, he thought, I’m going to propose to her right away.  And give her everything I’m capable of giving – every single thing.  Before I get lost in a dark forest.  Before the bad elves grab me. \\n Not everything was lost in the flow of time.  That’s what Tsukuru should have said to Eri when he said goodbye at the lakeside in Finland.  But at that point, he couldn’t put it into words. \\n We truly believed in something back then, and we knew we were the kind of people capable of believing in something – with all our hearts.  And that kind of hope will never simply vanish. \\n He calmed himself, shut his eyes, and fell asleep.  The rear light of consciousness, like the last express train of the night,  began to fade into the distance, gradually speeding up, growing smaller until it was, finally, sucked into the depths of the night, where it disappeared.  All that remained was the sound of the wind slipping through a stand of white birch trees. \\n '"

       "  'THIS DRASTIC CHANGE  took place during summer vacation of his sophomore year, between the first and second semesters.  Afterward, Tsukuru Tazaki’s life was changed forever, as if a sheer ridge had divided the original vegetation into two distinct biomes. \\n As always, when vacation rolled around he packed his belongings (though he did not have very many to begin with) and rode the bullet train back home.  After a short visit with his family in Nagoya, he called up his four friends, but he couldn’t get in touch with any of them.  All four of them were out, he was told.  He figured they must have gone out together somewhere.  He left a message with each of their families, went downtown to a movie theater in the shopping district, and killed time watching a movie he didn’t particularly want to see.  Back at home, he ate dinner with his family, then phoned each of his friends again.  No one had returned. \\n The next morning he called them again, with the same result: they were all still out.  He left another message with each family member who answered the phone.  Please have them call me when they get back, he said, and they promised to pass the message along.  But something in their voices bothered him.  He hadn’t noticed it the first time he called, but now he sensed something subtly different, as if, for some reason, they were trying to keep him at arm’s length.  As if they wanted to hang up on him as soon as possible.  Shiro’s older sister, in particular, was curt and abrupt.  Tsukuru had always gotten along very well with her – she was two years older than Shiro, and though not as stunning as Shiro, still a beautiful woman.  They often joked around when he called – or if not a joke, at least they exchanged a friendly greeting.  But now she hurriedly said goodbye, as if she could barely wait to end the conversation.  After he had called all four homes, Tsukuru was left feeling like an outcast, as if he were carrying some virulent pathogen that the others were desperately trying to avoid. \\n Something must have happened,  something  had taken place while he was away to make them create this distance.  Something inappropriate, and offensive.  But what it was – what it could possibly be – he simply had no clue. \\n He was left feeling like he’d swallowed a lump of something he shouldn’t have, something he couldn’t spit out, or digest.  He stayed home the whole day waiting for the phone to ring.  His mind was unfocused, and he was unable to concentrate.  He’d left repeated messages with his friends’ families, telling them he was in Nagoya.  Usually his friends would call right away and cheerfully welcome him back, but this time the phone remained implacably silent. \\n Tsukuru thought about calling them again in the evening, but then decided not to.  Maybe all of them really were at home.  Maybe they didn’t want to come to the phone and instead were pretending to be out.  Maybe they had told their families, ‘If Tsukuru Tazaki calls, tell him I’m not here.’  Which would explain why their family members sounded so ill at ease. \\n But why? \\n He couldn’t imagine a reason.  The last time the five of them had been together was in early May, during the Golden Week holidays.  When Tsukuru had taken the train back to Tokyo, his four friends had come to the station to see him off, giving him big, hearty, exaggerated waves through the window as the train pulled away, like he was a soldier being shipped off to the ends of the earth. \\n After that point, Tsukuru had written a couple of letters to Ao.  Shiro was hopeless with computers, so they normally relied on letters, and Ao was their contact person.  Tsukuru always addressed the letter to Ao, who made sure that the letters circulated among the others.  That way Tsukuru could avoid writing individual letters to everyone.  He mainly wrote about his life in Tokyo, what he saw there, what experiences he had, what he was feeling.  But always, no matter what he saw or did, he knew he would be having a much better time if the four of them were there to share the experience with him.  That’s how he really felt.  Other than that, he didn’t write anything much. \\n The other four wrote letters to him, jointly signed, but there was never anything negative in them.  They just reported in detail on what they’d been up to in Nagoya.  They’d all been born and raised there, but they seemed to be enjoying their college lives.  Ao had bought a used Honda Accord (with a stain on the backseat that looked like a dog had peed there, he reported, the kind of car five people could easily ride in, as long as none of them was too fat), and all of them piled into the car to take a trip to Lake Biwa.  Too bad you couldn’t go with us, Tsukuru, they wrote.  Looking forward to seeing you during the summer, they added.  To Tsukuru, it sounded like they meant it. \\n That night, after he still hadn’t heard from his friends, Tsukuru had trouble sleeping.  He felt agitated.  Random, senseless thoughts flitted around in his head.  But all these thoughts were just variations on one theme.  Like a man who has lost his sense of direction, Tsukuru’s thoughts endlessly circled the same place.  By the time he became aware of what his mind was doing, he found himself back where he’d started.  Finally, his thinking process got stuck, as if the folds of his brain were a broken screw. \\n He remained awake in bed until 4 a.m.  Then he fell asleep, but he woke up again shortly after six.  He didn’t feel like eating, and drank a glass of orange juice, but even that made him nauseous.  His lack of appetite worried his family, but he told them it was nothing.  My stomach’s just a little tired out, he explained. \\n Tsukuru stayed at home that day, too.  He lay next to the phone, reading a book, or at least trying to.  In the afternoon he called his friends’ homes again.  He didn’t feel like it, but he couldn’t just sit around with this baffling, disconcerting feeling, praying for the phone to ring. \\n The result was the same.  The family members who answered the phone told Tsukuru – curtly, or apologetically, or in an overly neutral tone of voice – that his friends weren’t at home.  Tsukuru thanked them, politely but briefly, and hung up.  This time he didn’t leave a message.  Probably they were as tired of pretending to be out as he was tired of trying to contact them.  He assumed that eventually the family members who were screening his calls might give up.  If he kept on calling, there had to be a reaction. \\n And eventually there was.  Just past eight that night, a call came from Ao. \\n ‘I’m sorry, but I have to ask you not to call any of us anymore,’ Ao said abruptly and without preface.  No ‘Hey!’  or ‘How’ve you been?’  or ‘It’s been a while.’  I’m sorry  was his only concession to social niceties. \\n Tsukuru took a breath, and silently repeated Ao’s words, quickly assessing them.  He tried to read the emotions behind them, but the words were like the formal recitation of an announcement.  There had been no room for feelings. \\n ‘If everybody’s telling me not to call them, then of course I won’t,’ Tsukuru replied.  The words slipped out, almost automatically.  He had tried to speak normally, calmly, but his voice sounded like a stranger’s.  The voice of someone living in a distant town, someone he had never met (and probably never would). \\n ‘Then don’t,’ Ao said. \\n ‘I don’t plan on doing anything people don’t want me to do,’ Tsukuru said. \\n Ao let out a sound, neither a sigh or a groan of agreement. \\n ‘But if possible, I do want to know the reason for this,’ Tsukuru said. \\n ‘That’s not something I can tell you,’ Ao replied. \\n ‘Then who can?’ \\n A thick stone wall rose.  There was silence on the other end.  Tsukuru could faintly hear Ao breathing through his nostrils.  He pictured Ao’s flat, fleshy nose. \\n ‘Think about it, and you’ll figure it out,’ Ao said, finally. \\n Tsukuru was speechless.  What was he talking about?  Think about it?  Think about  what ?  If I think any harder about anything, I won’t know who I am anymore. \\n ‘It’s too bad it turned out like this,’ Ao said. \\n ‘All of you feel this way?’ \\n ‘Yeah.  Everyone feels it’s too bad.’ \\n ‘Tell me – what happened?’  Tsukuru asked. \\n ‘You’d better ask yourself that,’ Ao said.  Tsukuru detected a quaver of sadness and anger in his voice, but it was just for an instant.  Before Tsukuru could think of how to respond, Ao had hung up. \\n — \\n ‘That’s all he told you?’  Sara asked. \\n ‘It was a short conversation, minimalist.  That’s the very best I can reproduce it.’ \\n The two of them were face-to-face across a small table in the bar. \\n ‘After that, did you ever talk with him, or any of the other three about it?’ \\n Tsukuru shook his head.  ‘No, I haven’t talked to any of them since then.’ \\n Sara’s eyes narrowed as she gazed at him, as if she were inspecting a scene that violated the laws of physics.  ‘None of them?’ \\n ‘I never saw any of them again.  And we’ve never spoken.’ \\n ‘But didn’t you want to know why they suddenly kicked you out of the group?’ \\n ‘I don’t know how to put it, but at the time nothing seemed to matter.  The door was slammed in my face, and they wouldn’t let me back inside.  And they wouldn’t tell me why.  But if that’s what all of them wanted, I figured there was nothing I could do about it.’ \\n ‘I don’t get it,’ Sara said, as if she really didn’t.  ‘It could have been a complete misunderstanding.  I mean, you couldn’t think of any reason why it happened?  Didn’t you find the whole thing deplorable?  That some stupid mistake might have led you to lose such close friends?  Why wouldn’t you try to clear up a misunderstanding that might have been easily rectified?’ \\n Her mojito glass was empty.  She signaled the bartender and asked for a wine list, and, after some deliberation, she chose a glass of Napa Cabernet Sauvignon.  Tsukuru had only drunk half his highball.  The ice had melted, forming droplets on the outside of his glass.  The paper coaster was wet and swollen. \\n ‘That was the first time in my life that anyone had rejected me so completely,’ Tsukuru said.  ‘And the ones who did it were the people I trusted the most, my four best friends in the world.  I was so close to them that they had been like an extension of my own body.  Searching for the reason, or correcting a misunderstanding, was beyond me.  I was simply, and utterly, in shock.  So much so that I thought I might never recover.  It felt like something inside me had snapped.’ \\n The bartender brought over the glass of wine and replenished the bowl of nuts.  Once he’d left, Sara turned to Tsukuru. \\n ‘I’ve never experienced that myself, but I think I can imagine how  stunned  you must have been.  I understand that you couldn’t recover from it quickly.  But still, after time had passed and the shock had worn off, wasn’t there something you could have done?  I mean, it was so unfair.  Why didn’t you challenge it?  I don’t see how you could stand it.’ \\n Tsukuru shook his head slightly.  ‘The next morning I made up some excuse to tell my family and took the bullet train back to Tokyo.  I couldn’t stand being in Nagoya for one more day.  All I could think of was getting away from there.’ \\n ‘If it had been me, I would have stayed there and not left until I got to the bottom of it,’ Sara said. \\n ‘I wasn’t strong enough for that,’ Tsukuru said. \\n ‘You didn’t want to find out the truth?’ \\n Tsukuru stared at his hands on the tabletop, carefully choosing his words.  ‘I think I was afraid of pursuing it, of whatever facts might come to light.  Of actually coming face-to-face with them.  Whatever the truth was, I didn’t think it would save me.  I’m not sure why, but I was certain of it.’ \\n ‘And you’re certain of it now?’ \\n ‘I don’t know,’ Tsukuru said.  ‘But I was then.’ \\n ‘So you went back to Tokyo, stayed holed up in your apartment, closed your eyes, and covered up your ears.’ \\n ‘You could say that, yes.’ \\n Sara reached out and rested her hand on top of his.  ‘Poor Tsukuru,’ she said.  The softness of her touch slowly spread through him.  After a moment she took her hand away and lifted the wineglass to her mouth. \\n ‘After that I went to Nagoya as seldom as possible,’ Tsukuru said.  ‘When I did return, I tried not to leave my house, and once I was done with whatever I had to do, I came back to Tokyo as quickly as I could.  My mother and older sisters were worried and asked me if something had happened, but I never said anything.  There was no way I could tell them.’ \\n ‘Do you know where the four of them are now, and what they’re doing?’ \\n ‘No, I don’t.  Nobody ever told me, and I never really wanted to know.’ \\n Sara swirled the wine in her glass and gazed at the ripples, as if reading someone’s fortune. \\n ‘I find this very strange,’ she said.  ‘That incident was obviously a huge shock, and in a way, it changed your life.  Don’t you think?’ \\n Tsukuru gave a small nod.  ‘In a lot of ways I’ve become a different person.’ \\n ‘How so?’ \\n ‘Well, I feel more often how dull and insignificant I am for other people.  And for myself.’ \\n Sara gazed into his eyes for a time, her voice serious.  ‘I don’t think you’re either dull or insignificant.’ \\n ‘I appreciate that,’ Tsukuru said.  He gently pressed his fingers against his temple.  ‘But that’s an issue I have to figure out on my own.’ \\n ‘I still don’t follow,’ Sara said.  ‘The pain caused by that incident is still in your mind, or your heart.  Or maybe both.  But I think it’s very clearly there.  Yet for the last fifteen or sixteen years you’ve never tried to trace the reason why you had to suffer like that.’ \\n ‘I’m not saying I didn’t feel like knowing the truth.  But after all these years, I think it’s better just to forget about it.  It was a long time ago, and it’s all sunk within the past.’ \\n Sara’s thin lips came together, and then she spoke.  ‘I think that’s dangerous.’ \\n ‘Dangerous?  How so?’ \\n ‘You can hide memories, suppress them, but you can’t erase the history that produced them.’  Sara looked directly into his eyes.  ‘If nothing else, you need to remember that.  You can’t erase history, or change it.  It would be like destroying yourself.’ \\n ‘Why are we talking about this?’  Tsukuru said, half to himself, trying to sound upbeat.  ‘I’ve never talked to anybody about this before, and never planned to.’ \\n Sara smiled faintly.  ‘Maybe you needed to talk with somebody.  More than you ever imagined.’ \\n That summer, after he returned to Tokyo from Nagoya, Tsukuru was transfixed by the odd sensation that, physically, he was being completely transformed.  Colors he’d once seen appeared completely different, as if they’d been covered by a special filter.  He heard sounds that he’d never heard before, and couldn’t make out other noises that had always been familiar.  When he moved, he felt clumsy and awkward, as if gravity were shifting around him. \\n For the five months after he returned to Tokyo, Tsukuru lived at death’s door.  He set up a tiny place to dwell, all by himself, on the rim of a dark abyss.  A perilous spot, teetering on the edge, where, if he rolled over in his sleep, he might plunge into the depth of the void.  Yet he wasn’t afraid.  All he thought about was how easy it would be to fall in. \\n All around him, for as far as he could see, lay a rough land strewn with rocks, with not a drop of water, nor a blade of grass.  Colorless, with no light to speak of.  No sun, no moon or stars.  No sense of direction, either.  At a set time, a mysterious twilight and a bottomless darkness merely exchanged places.  A remote border on the edges of consciousness.  At the same time, it was a place of strange abundance.  At twilight birds with razor-sharp beaks came to relentlessly scoop out his flesh.  But as darkness covered the land, the birds would fly off somewhere, and that land would silently fill in the gaps in his flesh with something else, some other indeterminate material. \\n Tsukuru couldn’t fathom what this substance was.  He couldn’t accept or reject it.  It merely settled on his body as a shadowy swarm, laying an ample amount of shadowy eggs.  Then darkness would withdraw and twilight would return, bringing with it the birds, who once again slashed away at his body. \\n He was himself then, but at the same time, he was not.  He was Tsukuru Tazaki, and not Tsukuru Tazaki.  When he couldn’t stand the pain, he distanced himself from his body and, from a nearby, painless spot, observed Tsukuru Tazaki enduring the agony.  If he concentrated really hard, it wasn’t impossible. \\n Even now that feeling would sometimes spring up.  The sense of leaving himself.  Of observing his own pain as if it were not his own. \\n After they left the bar Tsukuru invited Sara to dinner again.  Maybe we could just have a bite nearby?  he asked.  Grab a pizza?  I’m still not hungry, Sara replied.  Okay, Tsukuru said, then how about going back to my place? \\n ‘Sorry, but I’m not in the mood today,’ she said, reluctantly but firmly. \\n ‘Because I went on about all that stupid stuff?’  Tsukuru asked. \\n She gave a small sigh.  ‘No, that’s not it.  I’ve just got some thinking to do.  About all kinds of things.  So I’d like to go home alone.’ \\n ‘Of course,’ Tsukuru said.  ‘You know, I’m really glad I could see you again, and talk with you.  I just wish we’d had a more pleasant topic to talk about.’ \\n She pursed her lips tightly for a moment and then, as if coming to a decision, spoke.  ‘Would you ask me out again?  As long as you don’t mind, I mean.’ \\n ‘Of course.  If it’s okay with you.’ \\n ‘It is.’ \\n ‘I’m glad,’ Tsukuru said.  ‘I’ll email you.’ \\n They said goodbye at the subway entrance.  Sara took the escalator up to the Yamanote line and Tsukuru took the stairs down to the Hibiya line.  Each of them back to their homes.  Each lost in their own thoughts. \\n Tsukuru, of course, had no idea what Sara was thinking about.  And he didn’t want to reveal to her what was on his mind.  There are certain thoughts that, no matter what, you have to keep inside.  And it was those kinds of thoughts that ran through Tsukuru’s head as he rode the train home. \\n ')]"
