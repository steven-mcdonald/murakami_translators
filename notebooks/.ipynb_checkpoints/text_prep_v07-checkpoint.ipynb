       "'\\n Chapter 2 \\n The following document, classified Top Secret by the U.S. Department of Defense, was released to the public in 1986 through the Freedom of Information Act. The document is now kept in the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and can be accessed there. \\n The investigations recorded here were carried out under the direction of Major James P. Warren from March to April 1946. The field investigation in [name deleted]\\xa0County, Yamanashi Prefecture, was conducted by Second Lieutenant Robert O\\'Connor and Master Sergeant Harold Katayama. The interrogator in all interviews was Lt.\\xa0O\\'Connor. Sgt. Katayama handled the Japanese interpreting, and Private William Cohen prepared the documents. \\n Interviews were conducted over a twelve-day period in the reception room of the\\xa0[name deleted] Town town hall in Yamanashi Prefecture. The following witnesses responded individually to Lt. O\\'Connor\\'s questions: a female teacher at the [deleted]\\xa0Town [deleted] County public school, a doctor residing in the same town, two patrolmen assigned to the local police precinct, and six children. \\n The appended 1:10,000 and 1:2,000 maps of the area in question were provided by the Topographic Institute of the Ministry of Home Affairs. \\n \\n U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE SECTION (MIS) REPORT \\n Dated: May 12, 1946 \\n Title: Report on the Rice Bowl Hill Incident, 1944 \\n Document Number: PTYX-722-8936745-42213-WWN \\n The following is a taped interview with Setsuko Okamochi (26), teacher in charge of the fourth-grade B class at the public school in [deleted] Town,\\xa0[deleted] County. Materials related to the interview can be accessed using application number PTYX-722-SQ-118. \\n Impressions of the interviewer, Lt. Robert O\\'Connor: Setsuko Okamochi is an attractive, petite woman. Intelligent and responsible, she responded to the questions accurately and honestly. She still seems slightly in shock, though, from the incident. As she searched her memory she grew very tense at times, and whenever this happened she had a tendency to speak more slowly. \\n \\n I think it must have been just after ten in the morning when I saw a silver light far up in the sky. A brilliant flash of silver. That\\'s right, it was definitely light reflecting off something metal. That light moved very slowly in the sky from east to west. We all thought it had to be a B-29. It was directly above us, so to see it we had to look straight up. It was a clear blue sky, and the light was so bright all we could see was that silver, duralumin-like object. \\n But we couldn\\'t make out the shape, since it was too far up. I assumed that they couldn\\'t see us either, so we weren\\'t afraid of being attacked or having bombs suddenly rain down on us. Dropping bombs in the mountains here would be pretty pointless anyway. I figured the plane was on its way to bomb some large city somewhere, or maybe on its way back from a raid. So we kept on walking. All I thought was how that light had a strange beauty to it. \\n \\n —According to military records no U.S. bombers or any other kind of aircraft were flying over that region at the time, that is, around ten a.m. on November 7, 1944. \\n But I saw it clearly, and so did the sixteen children in my class. All of us thought it had to be a B-29. We\\'d all seen many formations of B-29s, and those are the only kind of planes that could possibly fly that high. There was a small airbase in our prefecture, and I\\'d occasionally seen Japanese planes flying, but they were all small and could never fly as high as what I saw. Besides, the way duralumin reflects light is different from other types of metal, and the only planes made out of that are B-29s. I did think it was a little strange, though, that it was a solo plane flying all by itself, not part of a formation. \\n \\n —Were you born in this region? \\n No, I was born in Hiroshima. I got married in 1941, and that\\'s when I came here. \\n My husband was a music teacher in a junior high school in this prefecture. He was called up in 1943 and died fighting in Luzon in June of 1945. From what I heard later, he was guarding an ammunition dump just outside Manila when it was hit by American shells and blew up, killing him. We have no children. \\n \\n —Speaking of children, how many were you in charge of on that outing? \\n Sixteen all together, boys and girls. Two were out sick, but other than that it was the entire class. Eight boys and eight girls. Five of them were children who\\'d been evacuated from Tokyo. \\n We set out from the school at nine in the morning. It was a typical school outing, so everyone carried canteens and lunches with them. We had nothing in particular we were planning to study; we were just going up into the hills to gather mushrooms and edible wild plants. The area around where we lived was farmland, so we weren\\'t that badly off in terms of food—which isn\\'t to say we had plenty to eat. There was a strict rationing system in place and most of us were hungry all the time. \\n So the children were encouraged to hunt for food wherever they could find it. The country was at war, after all, and food took priority over studying. Everyone went on this kind of school outing—outdoor study sessions, as they were called. Since our school was surrounded by hills and woods, there were a lot of nice spots we used to go to. I think we were blessed in that sense. People in cities were all starving. Supply routes from Taiwan and the continent had been cut off by this time and urban areas were suffering terribly from a lack of food and fuel. \\n \\n —You mentioned that five of your pupils had been evacuated from Tokyo. Did they get along well with the local children? \\n In my class at least they did. The environments the two groups grew up in, of course, were completely different—one way out in the country, the other in the heart of Tokyo. They spoke differently, even dressed differently. Most of the local kids were from poor farming families, while the majority of the Tokyo children had fathers who worked for companies or in the civil service. So I couldn\\'t say they really understood each other. \\n Especially in the beginning you could sense some tension between the two groups. \\n I\\'m not saying they bullied each other or got into fights, because they didn\\'t. What I mean is one group didn\\'t seem to understand what the other group was thinking. So they tended to keep to themselves, the local kids with other local kids, the Tokyo children in their own little group. This was only the first two months, though. After that they got along well. You know how it is. When kids start playing together and get completely absorbed by whatever they\\'re doing, they don\\'t care about things like that anymore. \\n \\n \\n —I\\'d like you to describe, in as much detail as you can, the spot where you took your class that day. \\n It was a hill we often went to on outings. It was a round hill shaped like an upside-down bowl. We usually called it \"Owan yama.\" [Note: \"Rice Bowl Hill.\"] It was a short walk to the west of the school and wasn\\'t steep at all, so anybody could climb it. \\n At the children\\'s pace it took somewhere around two hours to get to the top. Along the way they\\'d search the woods for mushrooms and we\\'d have a simple lunch. The children, naturally, enjoyed going on these outdoor sessions much more than staying in our classroom studying. \\n The glittering airplane we saw way up in the sky reminded us for a moment of the war, but just for a short time, and we were all in a good mood. There wasn\\'t a cloud in the sky, no wind, and everything was quiet around us—all we could hear were birds chirping in the woods. The war seemed like something in a faraway land that had nothing to do with us. We sang songs as we hiked up the hill, sometimes imitating the birds we heard. Except for the fact that the war was still going on, it was a perfect morning. \\n \\n —It was soon after you observed the airplane-like object that you went into the woods, correct? \\n That\\'s correct. I\\'d say it was less than five minutes later that we went into the woods. We left the main trail up the hill and went along a trampled-down path that went up the slope of the woods. It was pretty steep. After we\\'d hiked for about ten minutes we came to a clearing, a broad area as flat as a tabletop. Once we\\'d entered the woods it was completely still, and with the sun blocked out it was chilly, but when we stepped into that clearing it was like we were in a miniature town square, with the sky bright above us. My class often stopped by this spot whenever we climbed Owan yama. The place had a calming effect, and somehow made us all feel nice and cozy. \\n We took a break once we reached this \"square,\" putting down our packs, and then the children went into the woods in groups of three or four in search of mushrooms. I insisted that they never lose sight of one another. Before they set out, I gathered them all together and made sure they understood this. We knew the place well, but it was a woods, after all, and if any of them got separated and lost we\\'d have a hard time finding them. Still, you have to remember these are small children, and once they start hunting mushrooms they tend to forget this rule. So I always made sure that as I looked for mushrooms myself I kept an eye on them, and a running head count. \\n It was about ten minutes or so after we began hunting mushrooms that the children started to collapse. \\n When I first spotted a group of three of them collapsed on the ground I was sure they\\'d eaten poisonous mushrooms. There are a lot of highly toxic mushrooms around here, even ones that can be fatal. The local kids know which ones not to pick, but a few varieties are hard to distinguish. That\\'s why I always warned the children never to put any in their mouths until we got back to school and had an expert check them. But you can\\'t always expect kids to listen, can you? \\n I raced over to the spot and lifted up the children who\\'d fallen to the ground. \\n Their bodies were limp, like rubber that\\'s been left out in the sun. It was like carrying empty shells—the strength was completely drained from them. But they were breathing fine. Their pulses were normal, and none of them had a temperature. They looked calm, not at all like they were in any pain. I ruled out things like bee stings or snakebites. The children were simply unconscious. \\n The strangest thing was their eyes. Their bodies were so limp it was like they were in a coma, yet their eyes were open as if they were looking at something. They\\'d blink every once in a while, so it wasn\\'t like they were asleep. And their eyes moved very slowly from side to side like they were scanning a distant horizon. Their eyes at least were conscious. But they weren\\'t actually looking at anything, or at least nothing visible. I waved my hand a few times in front of their faces, but got no reaction. \\n I picked up each of the three children in turn, and they were all exactly the same. \\n All of them were unconscious, their eyes slowly moving from side to side. It was the weirdest thing I\\'d ever seen. \\n \\n —Describe the group that first collapsed. \\n It was a group of girls. Three girls who were all good friends. I called out their names and slapped them on the cheek, pretty hard, in fact, but there was no reaction. \\n They didn\\'t feel a thing. It was a strange feeling, like touching a void. \\n My first thought was to send somebody running back to the school for help. \\n There was no way I could carry three unconscious children down by myself. So I started looking for the fastest runner in the class, one of the boys. But when I stood up and looked around I saw that all the children had collapsed. All sixteen of them had fallen to the ground and lost consciousness. The only one still conscious and standing was me. It was like... a battlefield. \\n \\n —Did you notice anything unusual at the scene? Any strange smell or sound—or a light? \\n [Thinks about it for a while.] No, as I already said, it was very quiet and peaceful. \\n No unusual sounds or light or smells. The only thing unusual was that every single pupil in my class had collapsed and was lying there unconscious. I felt utterly alone, like I was the last person alive on Earth. I can\\'t describe that feeling of total loneliness. I just wanted to disappear into thin air and not think about anything. \\n Of course I couldn\\'t do that—I had my duty as a teacher. I pulled myself together and raced down the slope as fast as my legs would carry me, to get help at the school. \\n '"

       "  'Cash isn\\'t the only thing I take from my father\\'s study when I leave home. I take a small, old gold lighter—I like the design and feel of it—and a folding knife with a really sharp blade. Made to skin deer, it has a five-inch blade and a nice heft. Probably something he bought on one of his trips abroad. I also take a sturdy, bright pocket flashlight out of a drawer. Plus sky blue Revo sunglasses to disguise my age. \\n \\n I think about taking my father\\'s favorite Sea-Dweller Oyster Rolex. It\\'s a beautiful watch, but something flashy will only attract attention. My cheap plastic Casio watch with an alarm and stopwatch will do just fine, and might actually be more useful. \\n Reluctantly, I return the Rolex to its drawer. \\n From the back of another drawer I take out a photo of me and my older sister when we were little, the two of us on a beach somewhere with grins plastered across our faces. My sister\\'s looking off to the side so half her face is in shadow and her smile is neatly cut in half. It\\'s like one of those Greek tragedy masks in a textbook that\\'s half one idea and half the opposite. Light and dark. Hope and despair. Laughter and sadness. \\n Trust and loneliness. For my part I\\'m staring straight ahead, undaunted, at the camera. \\n Nobody else is there at the beach. My sister and I have on swimsuits—hers a red floral-print one-piece, mine some baggy old blue trunks. I\\'m holding a plastic stick in my hand. \\n White foam is washing over our feet. \\n Who took this, and where and when, I have no clue. And how could I have looked so happy? And why did my father keep just that one photo? The whole thing is a total mystery. I must have been three, my sister nine. Did we ever really get along that well? I have no memory of ever going to the beach with my family. No memory of going anywhere with them. No matter, though—there is no way I\\'m going to leave that photo with my father, so I put it in my wallet. I don\\'t have any photos of my mother. My father threw them all away. \\n After giving it some thought I decide to take the cell phone with me. Once he finds out I\\'ve taken it, my father will probably get the phone company to cut off service. \\n Still, I toss it into my backpack, along with the adapter. Doesn\\'t add much weight, so why not. When it doesn\\'t work anymore I\\'ll just chuck it. \\n Just the bare necessities, that\\'s all I need. Choosing which clothes to take is the hardest thing. I\\'ll need a couple sweaters and pairs of underwear. But what about shirts and trousers? Gloves, mufflers, shorts, a coat? There\\'s no end to it. One thing I do know, though. I don\\'t want to wander around some strange place with a huge backpack that screams out, Hey, everybody, check out the runaway! Do that and someone is sure to sit up and take notice. Next thing you know the police will haul me in and I\\'ll be sent straight home. If I don\\'t wind up in some gang first. \\n Any place cold is definitely out, I decide. Easy enough, just choose the opposite—a warm place. Then I can leave the coat and gloves behind, and get by with half the clothes. I pick out wash-and-wear-type things, the lightest ones I have, fold them neatly, and stuff them in my backpack. I also pack a three-season sleeping bag, the kind that rolls up nice and tight, toilet stuff, a rain poncho, notebook and pen, a Walkman and ten discs—got to have my music—along with a spare rechargeable battery. That\\'s about it. No need for any cooking gear, which is too heavy and takes up too much room, since I can buy food at the local convenience store. \\n It takes a while but I\\'m able to subtract a lot of things from my list. I add things, cross them off, then add a whole other bunch and cross them off, too. \\n \\n My fifteenth birthday is the ideal time to run away from home. Any earlier and it\\'d be too soon. Any later and I would have missed my chance. \\n During my first two years in junior high, I\\'d worked out, training myself for this day. I started practicing judo in the first couple years of grade school, and still went sometimes in junior high. But I didn\\'t join any school teams. Whenever I had the time I\\'d jog around the school grounds, swim, or go to the local gym. The young trainers there gave me free lessons, showing me the best kind of stretching exercises and how to use the fitness machines to bulk up. They taught me which muscles you use every day and which ones can only be built up with machines, even the correct way to do a bench press. I\\'m pretty tall to begin with, and with all this exercise I\\'ve developed pretty broad shoulders and pecs. Most strangers would take me for seventeen. If I ran away looking my actual age, you can imagine all the problems that would cause. \\n Other than the trainers at the gym and the housekeeper who comes to our house every other day—and of course the bare minimum required to get by at school—I barely talk to anyone. For a long time my father and I have avoided seeing each other. We live under the same roof, but our schedules are totally different. He spends most of his time in his studio, far away, and I do my best to avoid him. \\n The school I\\'m going to is a private junior high for kids who are upper-class, or at least rich. It\\'s the kind of school where, unless you really blow it, you\\'re automatically promoted to the high school on the same campus. All the students dress neatly, have nice straight teeth, and are boring as hell. Naturally I have zero friends. I\\'ve built a wall around me, never letting anybody inside and trying not to venture outside myself. Who could like somebody like that? They all keep an eye on me, from a distance. They might hate me, or even be afraid of me, but I\\'m just glad they didn\\'t bother me. Because I had tons of things to take care of, including spending a lot of my free time devouring books in the school library. \\n I always paid close attention to what was said in class, though. Just like the boy named Crow suggested. \\n The facts and techniques or whatever they teach you in class isn\\'t going to be very useful in the real world, that\\'s for sure. Let\\'s face it, teachers are basically a bunch of morons. But you\\'ve got to remember this: you\\'re running away from home. You probably won\\'t have any chance to go to school anymore, so like it or not you\\'d better absorb whatever you can while you\\'ve got the chance. Become like a sheet of blotting paper and soak it all in. Later on you can figure out what to keep and what to unload. \\n I did what he said, like I almost always do. My brain like a sponge, I focused on every word said in class and let it all sink in, figured out what it meant, and committed everything to memory. Thanks to this, I barely had to study outside of class, but always came out near the top on exams. \\n My muscles were getting hard as steel, even as I grew more withdrawn and quiet. \\n I tried hard to keep my emotions from showing so that no one—classmates and teachers alike—had a clue what I was thinking. Soon I\\'d be launched into the rough adult world, and I knew I\\'d have to be tougher than anybody if I wanted to survive. \\n My eyes in the mirror are cold as a lizard\\'s, my expression fixed and unreadable. I can\\'t remember the last time I laughed or even showed a hint of a smile to other people. \\n Even to myself. \\n I\\'m not trying to imply I can keep up this silent, isolated facade all the time. \\n Sometimes the wall I\\'ve erected around me comes crumbling down. It doesn\\'t happen very often, but sometimes, before I even realize what\\'s going on, there I am—naked and defenseless and totally confused. At times like that I always feel an omen calling out to me, like a dark, omnipresent pool of water. \\n A dark, omnipresent pool of water. \\n It was probably always there, hidden away somewhere. But when the time comes it silently rushes out, chilling every cell in your body. You drown in that cruel flood, gasping for breath. You cling to a vent near the ceiling, struggling, but the air you manage to breathe is dry and burns your throat. Water and thirst, cold and heat—these supposedly opposite elements combine to assault you. \\n The world is a huge space, but the space that will take you in—and it doesn\\'t have to be very big—is nowhere to be found. You seek a voice, but what do you get? Silence. \\n You look for silence, but guess what? All you hear over and over and over is the voice of this omen. And sometimes this prophetic voice pushes a secret switch hidden deep inside your brain. \\n Your heart is like a great river after a long spell of rain, spilling over its banks. \\n All signposts that once stood on the ground are gone, inundated and carried away by that rush of water. And still the rain beats down on the surface of the river. Every time you see a flood like that on the news you tell yourself: That\\'s it. That\\'s my heart. \\n Before running away from home I wash my hands and face, trim my nails, swab out my ears, and brush my teeth. I take my time, making sure my whole body\\'s well scrubbed. Being really clean is sometimes the most important thing there is. I gaze carefully at my face in the mirror. Genes I\\'d gotten from my father and mother—not that I have any recollection of what she looked like—created this face. I can do my best to not let any emotions show, keep my eyes from revealing anything, bulk up my muscles, but there\\'s not much I can do about my looks. I\\'m stuck with my father\\'s long, thick eyebrows and the deep lines between them. I could probably kill him if I wanted to—I\\'m sure strong enough—and I can erase my mother from my memory. But there\\'s no way to erase the DNA they passed down to me. If I wanted to drive that away I\\'d have to get rid of me. \\n There\\'s an omen contained in that. A mechanism buried inside of me. \\n A mechanism buried inside of you. \\n I switch off the light and leave the bathroom. A heavy, damp stillness lies over the house. The whispers of people who don\\'t exist, the breath of the dead. I look around, standing stock-still, and take a deep breath. The clock shows three p. m., the two hands cold and distant. They\\'re pretending to be noncommittal, but I know they\\'re not on my side. It\\'s nearly time for me to say good-bye. I pick up my backpack and slip it over my shoulders. I\\'ve carried it any number of times, but now it feels so much heavier. \\n Shikoku, I decide. That\\'s where I\\'ll go. There\\'s no particular reason it has to be Shikoku, only that studying the map I got the feeling that\\'s where I should head. The more I look at the map—actually every time I study it—the more I feel Shikoku tugging at me. It\\'s far south of Tokyo, separated from the mainland by water, with a warm climate. I\\'ve never been there, have no friends or relatives there, so if somebody started looking for me—which I kind of doubt—Shikoku would be the last place they\\'d think of. \\n I pick up the ticket I\\'d reserved at the counter and climb aboard the night bus. \\n This is the cheapest way to get to Takamatsu—just a shade over ninety bucks. Nobody pays me any attention, asks how old I am, or gives me a second look. The bus driver mechanically checks my ticket. \\n Only a third of the seats are taken. Most passengers are traveling alone, like me, and the bus is strangely silent. It\\'s a long trip to Takamatsu, ten hours according to the schedule, and we\\'ll be arriving early in the morning. But I don\\'t mind. I\\'ve got plenty of time. The bus pulls out of the station at eight, and I push my seat back. No sooner do I settle down than my consciousness, like a battery that\\'s lost its charge, starts to fade away, and I fall asleep. \\n Sometime in the middle of the night a hard rain begins to fall. I wake up every once in a while, part the chintzy curtain at the window, and gaze out at the highway rushing by. Raindrops beat against the glass, blurring streetlights alongside the road that stretch off into the distance at identical intervals like they were set down to measure the earth. A new light rushes up close and in an instant fades off behind us. I check my watch and see it\\'s past midnight. Automatically shoved to the front, my fifteenth birthday makes its appearance. \\n \"Hey, happy birthday,\" the boy named Crow says. \\n \"Thanks,\" I reply. \\n The omen is still with me, though, like a shadow. I check to make sure the wall around me is still in place. Then I close the curtain and fall back asleep. \\n ')]"
